<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Student Development</strong> 
<br>At ACS (Junior), we view the young gentlemen who pass through our gates
as unique individuals, with different talents and strengths. We believe
that each of them has the potential to flourish and live a fulfilling life
as an individual, a family member, a friend, a community member, and a
citizen of Singapore and the world. Through their everyday interactions
with others and various learning experiences, we hope to guide them in
developing their character and citizenship competencies and dispositions.</p>

<p>The three guiding principles:
<br>&nbsp;<strong><u>Principle 1</u></strong> 
<br>Values are at the base as they guide and provide the purpose for oneâ€™s
behaviours. These values are our school core values. Actions without grounding
in values would lead to inconsistency in purpose and actions&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Principle 2</u></strong> 
<br>All ACSians can be and should be developed as a leader. Student leadership
development needs to be intentional thus we provide structured leadership
opportunities for students to realise their personal potential through
the school CCE programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Principle 3</u></strong> 
<br>During their stint as leaders, our students will be empowered by the teachers-in-charge
in serving their peers as leadership is an action, not a position. They
will be empowered with the servant leadership attributes.</p>
