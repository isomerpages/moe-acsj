As such, our role is to inculcate values as well as build competencies which are essential in developing each individual. This is done through various school programmes such as:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Citizenship Education</p></li><li><p>Co-Curricular Activities</p></li><li><p>Creative Thinkers Programme</p></li><li><p>Form Teacher Guidance Programme</p></li><li><p>Student Management Programme</p></li><li><p>Student Leadership Development</p></li><li><p>Student Well-Being</p></li><li><p>Values Education (in the Mother Tongue Languages)</p></li><li><p>Values-In-Action Programme</p></li></ul><p><strong>Student Leadership</strong><br>Objectives:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>To proudly serve the society and school with integrity, respect and compassion</p></li><li><p>To set discipline standards and inspire the student body to achieve high standards of discipline</p></li><li><p>To uphold and preserve the traditions of the school</p></li><li><p>To lead in the organisation of school activities, and to rally the support of the student body</p></li><li><p>To represent the views and opinions of the pupils and to help meet their needs</p></li><li><p>To help integrate new pupils of the school into the ACS(J) way of life</p></li></ul><p>The conceptual map showing the values of our leaders, their training and the desired outcome:</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE_Leadership_Model.jpg"></div><p>The three guiding principles:<br>&nbsp;<u>Principle 1</u><br>Values are at the base as they guide and provide the purpose for oneâ€™s behaviours. These values are our school core values. Actions without grounding in values would lead to inconsistency in purpose and actions&nbsp;</p><p><u>Principle 2</u><br>All ACSians can be and should be developed as a leader. Student leadership development needs to be intentional thus we provide structured leadership opportunities for students to realise their personal potential through the school CCE programme.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Principle 3</u><br>During their stint as leaders, our students will be empowered by the teachers-in-charge in serving their peers as leadership is an action, not a position. They will be empowered with the servant leadership attributes.</p><p><strong>Values-In-Action</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ccevia.jpg"></div><p><br></p>
