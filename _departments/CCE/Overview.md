<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>At ACS (Junior), we view the young gentlemen who pass through our gates
as unique individuals, with different talents and strengths. We believe
that each of them has the potential to flourish and live a fulfilling life
as an individual, a family member, a friend, a community member, and a
citizen of Singapore and the world. Through their everyday interactions
with others and various learning experiences, we hope to guide them in
developing their character and citizenship competencies and dispositions.</p>
