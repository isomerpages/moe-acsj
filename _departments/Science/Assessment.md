==========

<b><u>SKILLS AND PROCESSES</u></b><br>
Pupils are provided with opportunities to apply learned concepts and skills, by engaging the surrounding environment and its processes and phenomena, for the purpose of inquiry, awareness and self-development.

<b><u>Skills</u></b><br>
<u>Observing</u><br>
This is the skill of using our senses to gather information about objects or events. This also includes the use of instruments to extend the range of our senses.

<u>Comparing</u><br>
This is the skill of identifying the similarities and differences between two or more objects, concepts or processes.

<u>Classifying&nbsp;</u><br>
This is the skill of grouping objects or events based on common characteristics.

<u>Using apparatus and equipment</u><br>
This is the skill of knowing the functions and limitations of various apparatus, and developing the ability to select and handle them appropriately for various tasks.

<u>Communicating</u><br>

<u>Inferring</u><br>
This is the skill of interpreting or explaining observations or pieces of data or information.

<u>Predicting</u><br>
This is the skill of assessing the likelihood of an outcome based on prior knowledge of how things usually turn out.

<u>Analysing</u><br>
This is the skill of identifying the parts of objects, information or processes, and the patterns and relationships between these parts.

<u>Generating possibilities</u><br>
This is the skill of exploring all the alternatives, possibilities and choices beyond the obvious or preferred one.
