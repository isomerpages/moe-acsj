Programmes
==========

Enrichment programmes in school and to select locations where skilled trainers alongside our experienced teachers conduct a series of science enrichment programmes to complement Science teaching and learning done in school.

Special emphasis on the hands-on activities and experiential journeys aims to captivate their imagination while illuminating essential scientific concepts and methods.

P1 Science PAL Programme

This programme sparks pupils' interest in learning Science, via specially designed multimedia presentations, group discussions and pupil-centred activities. Students engage with relevant subject matter that reinforce the foundational Science concepts and topics necessary to progress through the curriculum.

The objectives are for the pupils to understand and be able to explain the following:

*   Classification - Why we sort things in groups
*   characteristics of living things and non-living things
*   characteristics of main groups of living things
    
    \- difference Between Plants and Animals
    
    \- characteristics of the main groups of Animals - Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fish and Insects (with specific focus on Mammals).
    

P2 Science PAL Programme

This programme sparks pupils' interest in learning Science, via specially designed multimedia presentations, group discussions and pupil-centred activities. Students engage with relevant subject matter that reinforce the foundational Science concepts and topics necessary to progress through the curriculum.

  

The objectives are for the pupils to understand and be able to explain the following :

*   characteristics of Amphibians
*   differences between warm-blooded & cold-blooded animals

P3 Fun with Animals

The objectives are for pupils to:

*   discover the diversity of animals  
    
*   learn about the physical features of a variety of animals  
    
*   compare their similarities and differences  
    
*   explore the different ways of classifying them  
    

P4 Adopt-A-Tillandsia 

The objectives are for pupils to:

*   learn the unique adaptation of Tillandsia  
    
*   learn that Tillandsia have special leaves that take in water, air and nutrients  
    
*   learn how to take care of the environment and live in harmony with nature  
    

P5 Science Centre: Diversity of Cells

The objective is for students to:

*   learn about cell diversity

*    experience hands-on practical lab session on cell diversity including yeast, pond organisms, animal, plant and bacterial cells  
    
*    learn how to use the microscope to view and identify various cells, how to make a wet-mount slide preparation and how to make simple staining for identification of cells

P6 Science Centre: Aquatic Plants & Animals

The objective is for students to:  

*   observe and experience a diversity of life forms from microscopic algae to pond skaters, dragon flies, tadpoles and other organisms in a pond community  
    
*   learn field techniques to catch and observe a variety of aquatic plants (some floating, fully submerged and partially submerged) and animals which make up the pond community  
    
*   learn about the aquatic plants and animals that live in and near the pond  
    
*   learn how these plants and animals are interdependent on each other for survival  
    

Creative Science Investigation (Recess Programme on selected Tuesdays)

P1 to P2 (at 9.35am)

P3 to P4 (at 10.05am)

P5 to P6 (at 10.35am)

CSI promotes school values, curiosity, collaboration and excellence, through scientific investigations and discovery. Pupils are able to inquire, discover, test hypotheses and satisfy their own curiosity about things around them with hands-on activities, show and tell, puzzles, games, treasure hunt in the eco-garden etc. It is carried out during recess for 15 minutes on Tuesdays for P3s and P4s. Pupils get to work in pairs and individually and are free to complete the activity at their own pace.

ACS Junior Professor Card

P3 to P6

The objectives of the Science Cards are to stimulate interest in Science through hands-on activities that encourage independent learning, provide opportunities for students to stimulate their curiosity about the natural environment and to develop skills and attitudes for life-long learning. 

Self-directed activities are designed for students to explore the school’s Eco-garden. Students have the opportunity to leverage on existing infrastructure to complete their tasks e.g. Herb Garden, Eco-ponds, Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Fern Garden and Aquarium. 

Students will collect a minimum number of reward stars for the completed activities. They will be presented with a certificate at the end of the year.

Learning trails at the Eco-garden and Aquarium

Our Eco-Garden and Aquarium provide a wealth of opportunities for our pupils to observe and interact with living specimens while applying lessons from many different areas of their curriculum. Pupils can study plant anatomy and botanical life science. They can practice the scientific method by carrying out experiments in the garden and collecting data on plant growth.

Pupils learn by experiencing nature first-hand at our campus eco-garden. They learn to appreciate the variety of plants and animals. They observe and identify flowering plants, non-flowering plants, ferns, herbs, the many habitats of animals and even more. Pupils investing time at the eco-garden are rewarded with a greater appreciation for the diversity, vastness and interconnectedness of living organisms.
