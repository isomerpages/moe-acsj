Special Educational Needs Officers
==================================

Special Educational Needs Officers (SENO) work with teachers to nurture and develop the students with learning differences in school by supporting them in class or pull-out classes based on their learning and/or social needs.  They work on levelling up the students in these areas so that they can access the curriculum in class and/or interact appropriately and form friendships with other students. The AEDs will also build rapport with the students to help them improve their self-confidence and self-esteem as well as grow them into independence for life's journey.
