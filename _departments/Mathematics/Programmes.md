<h1>Programmes</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Math Playground</strong>
<br>The Math Playground programme is designed to spark students’ interest
in Mathematics through the use of fun and engaging games. These games help
to reinforce mathematical concepts and strengthen factual fluency. Through
collaborative play, students also develop teamwork as they work together
to solve mathematical challenges.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Thoburn Mathematics</strong>
<br>The Thoburn Mathematics Programme seeks to stretch high-ability boys in
their cognitive domain. It builds on MOE’s Mathematics framework. Topics
have been selected for enrichment and tasks have been designed to extend
beyond the text. It also encourages the investigation of real-life problems
and boys are encouraged to make interdisciplinary connections. Many of
the tasks designed require open-ended problem-solving skills and they require
boys to embark on some research.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Mathematics Olympiad Training</strong>
<br>P4 to P6 students who have shown aptitude in Mathematics will participate
in Mathematics Olympiad Training. The training aims to equip the students
with the necessary skills and concepts to solve challenging mathematical
problems that involve higher order thinking.</p>
