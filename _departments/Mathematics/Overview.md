<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Mathematics Department aims to nurture every ACSian into a passionate
learner and a confident, creative problem-solver.</p>
<p>We strive to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create a dynamic and engaging learning environment that equips ACSians
with the skills to apply Mathematics in real-life situations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a holistic Mathematics programme across three key areas: <em>Fun in Mathematics</em>, <em>Discovery in Mathematics</em>,
and <em>Mastery in Mathematics</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspire students to think critically, solve problems creatively, and develop
a lifelong passion for Mathematics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>FUN in MATHEMATICS (P1 and P2)</u></strong>
<br>At the lower primary level, the focus is on cultivating joy in learning
Mathematics. Students are engaged in hands-on activities, games, and basic
heuristics to build foundational understanding. They are introduced to
simple model drawing as a visual strategy to solve problems. These experiences
aim to develop their confidence and curiosity from an early stage.</p>
<p><strong><u>DISCOVERY in MATHEMATICS (P3 and P4)</u></strong>
<br>In middle primary, students explore real-life applications of Mathematics
to discover its relevance and meaning in the world around them. Games continue
to be used to reinforce learning in a fun and interactive way. Students
who demonstrate strong aptitude and interest in Mathematics may be selected
to join the <em>Thoburn Programme</em>, where they delve deeper into Mathematical
concepts through problem investigation and interdisciplinary connections.</p>
<p><strong><u>MASTERY in MATHEMATICS (P5 and P6)</u></strong>
<br>At the upper primary level, the emphasis shifts towards consolidation
and mastery of key Mathematical concepts. Students are challenged to apply
their learning in more complex contexts. Those with a strong aptitude for
Mathematics can further stretch their potential through the <em>Math Olympiad</em> and <em>Thoburn</em> programmes.
Students who benefit from additional support are placed in the <em>Mathematics Foundation Programme</em>,
where they receive targeted instruction tailored to their learning needs
and pace.</p>
<p><strong><u>Mathematics Framework</u></strong>
<br>The central focus of the mathematics curriculum is the development of
mathematical problem-solving competency. Supporting this focus are five
inter-related components â€“ concepts, skills, processes, metacognition and
attitudes.</p>
