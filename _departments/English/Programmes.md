Programmes
==========

**The Read Up! Programme**

This is a voluntary programme where boys record the titles that they read onto a Log Sheet. Parent Volunteers and Teachers act as Reading Mentors, and "audit" the boys' reading, asking simple questions about the books the boys have read and discussing the content with them. If the Mentors are satisfied that the boys have read the books, one or more credits are awarded and recorded on the log sheet.

After certain numbers of credits have been attained, a Reward Card is issued to the boys. The Reward Cards come in series, and there is an incentive to complete the series by reading more books. Special cards are also earned at certain mile-stones, to keep the motivation up.

The programme has thus far received enthusiastic response, with many boys collecting forms and starting on their reading journey. Reading Mentors are on duty at all 3 recesses. Besides validating the reading efforts of the boys, the Mentors have been actively shaping the reading behaviour of the boys, steering them towards more challenging texts and quality fiction (such as Newbery/Carnegie Award winning books) and, in the process of dialoguing with the pupils, enriching their communication skills.

**Remedial Reading / Oral Enrichment Programme**  
There are small pockets of parent volunteers who conduct weekly remedial reading classes to encourage reluctant readers across the lower primary levels to make a first step into books. This is over and above the support given by the school. Additionally, at the P6 level, we have a preparatory programme for the PSLE EL Oral for pupils who are weaker in their oral communication skills. The sessions are spread over 3 Terms leading up to the PSLE Oral. On average, both parent volunteers and teachers function as trainers and support about 20 pupils in total each year. Besides working on reading and conversational skills, parent volunteers and teachers also expose pupils to library books.
