Assessment
==========

**ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK**

**Assessment Philosophy**<br>
We assess pupils on their ability to listen to, read, view, speak, write and represent through a variety of tasks and in a variety of contexts, using language that is accurate and fluent. Both the processes as well as the products of language learning are assessed to check for understanding and provide timely feedback. Assessment tasks are set in authentic settings and contexts of accurate and meaningful language use. The assessment tasks can be completed in print and/or non-print modes. They are also used to evaluate pupils' grammatical and lexical accuracy at the word, sentence and text levels.

**Important Note:**

###### 1.  Any pupil who is absent for a weighted assessment needs to produce a Medical Certificate to cover him for that day.Â Marks will be pro-rated accordingly.
###### 2.  For Semestral Assessment, there is no make-up for Listening Comprehension and main written papers. Pupils will not be eligible for academic awards if they are absent for Semestral Assessment main papers.**
