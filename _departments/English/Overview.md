Overview
========

**VISION**<br>
The English Language department seeks to develop boys who can communicate fluently, appropriately and effectively in internationally-acceptable English by providing a strong foundation and rich language for all.

**Principles & Approaches**<br>
The six Principles of EL Teaching and Learning (CLLIPS), adapted from the English Language Syllabus, are:

<u>Contextualization</u><br>
Learning tasks and activities will be designed for pupils to learn the language in authentic and meaningful contexts of use. For example, lessons will be planned around learning outcomes, a theme, or a type of text to help pupils use related language skills, grammatical items/structures and vocabulary appropriately in spoken and written language to suit the purpose, audience, context and culture. Learning points will be reinforced through explicit instruction and related follow-up practice.

<u>Learner-Centredness</u><br>
Learners are at the centre of the teaching-learning process. Teaching will be differentiated according to pupils' needs, abilities and interests. Effective pedagogies will be used to engage them and to strengthen their language development.

<u>Learning-Focused Interaction</u><br>
The teacher will provide a rich environment for communication that will explicitly foster listening and speaking skills and focus on the achievement of the Learning Outcomes. At the same time, the teacher will actively engage pupils by encouraging participation in their learning, boosting their confidence in the use of language, and promoting collaboration among learners from different socio-cultural backgrounds.

<u>Integration</u><br>
The Areas of language learning - the receptive skills, the productive skills, and grammar and vocabulary will be taught in an integrated way, together with the use of relevant print and non-print resources, to provide multiple perspectives and meaningful connections. 

<u>Process Orientation</u><br>
The development of language skills and knowledge about language involves the teaching of processes. The teacher will model and scaffold such processes for pupils, while guiding them to put together their final spoken, written and/or multi-modal products. 

<u>Spiral Progression</u><br>
Skills, grammatical items, structures and various types of texts will be taught, revised and revisited at increasing levels of difficulty and sophistication. This will allow pupils to progress from the foundational level to higher levels of language use.
