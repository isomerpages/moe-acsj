Overview
========

Innovation is _something different_ _that creates value_. The vagueness of the word _something_ is a reminder that innovation is not the job of the few but the responsibility of the many. The focus on creating value reminds us that innovation isn’t an academic activity; it is an active one! _Creating value_ distinguishes innovation from its precursors, such as creativity and invention.

At Anglo-Chinese School (Junior), we strive to shift learners from:

*   Consumers of knowledge to Creators of knowledge (K)
*   Communicators to Connectors (C)
*   Concerned Citizens to Active Contributors (A)
*   Results-driven to Process-focused (P)

To meet the overarching objective of **_A_**_dapting ideas, **C**reating solutions, **S**erving needs_, a whole-school approach to the thinking protocol based on “Understand, Plan, Act, Reflect” is adopted for a more pervasive implementation and to serve as a common language across departments.
