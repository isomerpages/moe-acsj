<h1>Programmes</h1>
<p>Our <strong>Digital Gentlemen Programme (DGP)</strong> is a curriculum designed
to equip every student with the skills and mindset to navigate the digital
world with confidence, creativity, and character.</p>
<p>The DGP follows a three-stage developmental pathway, ensuring that technology
use is age-appropriate and purposeful.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Foundation:</strong> The Digital Foundation Programme is
a whole-cohort initiative focused on establishing a safe and responsible
relationship with technology from the very start. It goes beyond basic
skills to build a strong ethical core, and is delivered through schoolwide
FTGP curriculum and other department initiatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Exploration: </strong>A tiered initiative for Middle Primary
students, focusing on discovery and application. This programme is designed
to move beyond foundational skills and ignite curiosity through hands-on,
project-based learning. It is delivered through the school’s Interdisciplinary
Project Work at Primary 3 and 4, Code For Fun Programmes, and curated CCA
clubs and special interest groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Creation: </strong>For students to transition from consumers
to creators and innovators. This programme challenges students to apply
their digital skills to solve real-world problems. It can be implemented
as a series of workshops, modules, or project-based learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By incorporating the <strong>“Find, Think, Apply, Create”</strong> framework
and the nine key digital competencies of the MOE EdTech Masterplan, we
ensure that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Find:</strong> Students efficiently navigate and curate digital
information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think:</strong> Students critically analyze and evaluate online
content and AI outputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply:</strong> Students use technology to enhance their understanding
of core subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create:</strong> Students leverage digital platforms to express
original ideas and innovate solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the Digital Gentlemen Programme, we empower our students to lead
with heart and use technology as a force for good in an ever-evolving world.</p>
