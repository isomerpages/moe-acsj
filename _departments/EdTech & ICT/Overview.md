Overview
========

**Transforming Education through Technology**

In alignment with the **EdTech Masterplan 2030**, we are redefining the classroom for the future. Our department goes beyond simply providing tools; we weave digital and AI literacy into a holistic ecosystem where students move from passive consumers to ethical creators.

By tailoring our digital curriculum to a boys-centric education, we harness the natural curiosity and hands-on learning styles of our young gentlemen. We leverage ICT to foster high engagement and collaborative problem-solving, empowering our students to navigate and lead the digital frontier with confidence and integrity.
