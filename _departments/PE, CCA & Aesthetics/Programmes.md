Programmes
==========

<u>Holistic Health Programme (HHP)</u><br>
With a variety of assembly programmes, we encourage pupils to adopt a healthy lifestyle and take ownership for their total well-being (physical, social and emotional).

Play@Recess activities are also organized for our pupils, where they are encouraged to participate in interactive games with their classmates, peers and teachers.

Pupils have opportunities to participate in intra-school events such as the Annual Track & Field Championships, Annual Swimming Championships, Pri.1 & Pri.2 Games Day, Junior Olympics and Tennis Open. This provides pupils with the opportunity to experience competition and demonstrate values such as excellence and perseverance.

<u>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</u><br>
PAL equips our pupils with the necessary skills and values to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised future. The programme provides exposure to our P1 and P2 pupils in two broad areas carried out on a modular basis within curriculum time:

Sports (P1) and Outdoor Education (P2) <br>
Visual and Performing Arts (P1 & P2)

<u>Physical Education (PE)</u><br>
We aim to develop our pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective and social domains through a structured and progressive curriculum in line with the 2014 PE Syllabus. By exposing them to different types of physical activities and games, they learn new concepts and hone their skills. Through PE lessons, they are also given an opportunity to practise responsibility, discipline, sportsmanship, fair-play and team-work.

<u>Learning for Life Programme (Tennis)</u><br>
All P2 to P6 pupils undergo 10 to 15 sessions of PE (Tennis). The programme aims to give every pupil the opportunity to experience tennis as a sport which builds discipline, concentration and mental strength, as well as inculcate in them our school values such as integrity, excellence and collaboration.

<b><u>Aesthetics</b></u><br>
**The Aesthetics Department believes that learning the Arts:**
1\) fosters students' sense of identity, culture and place in society<br>
2\) builds students' capacity to critically discern and process visual and audio information<br>
3\) teaches students to communicate effectively in the 21st century<br>
 4\) expands imagination and creativity 
 

**Art**<br>
Our Art Curriculum is designed to develop students holistically and we believe that the experience and journey of students' learning are far more important than the end product. Our Art Curriculum focuses on meaningful Art Making Processes. These are made possible with learning through **Inquiry-based learning pedagogy, Visible-Thinking Routines and learning with the 3 Art Learning Domains: See, Express and Appreciate.** 

Inquiry-based learning fuels self-directed learning and encourages students to take ownership of their education or learn from their peers. Our Art tasks are engaging and allow students to **unfold knowledge independently** or through **collaborative learning.** 

Our curriculum ensures students are equipped with the **visual inquiry skills to discover and explore their surroundings. Our Art programs are designed to expose students to different art mediums** in 6 years of Art Education. The project themes and hands-on activities for the students are designed **based on their profiles and interest.** This build ACSians’ self-confidence in the journey of discovering their strength in Art through the 6 year program. We ensure each child discovers the best outlet to express their voice and ideas through experimentation with art mediums and materials.

**Music**<br>
Our Music curriculum aims to develop a culture of excellence in the Arts by providing opportunities for students to develop skills in appreciating, creating and the expression in music through exposure, experience and excursions. 

Our music curriculum allows students to:

*   Develop awareness and appreciate music in local and global cultures
*   Develop ability for creative expression and communication through music
*   Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music

Various programmes and music modules are infused into our Music curriculum to provide platforms for students to experience different art forms as well as to help them discover their potentials and talents in music.

## table

**World Music**<br>
We believe in the teaching of “World Music”, a phrase for styles of music from different countries, including intercultural and traditional music. “World Music” provides insight into different cultures, rhythms, sounds, instruments and ways of making music. It enables our students to become better informed musicians and citizens of the world. In each module, students are introduced to traditional songs, song games, instruments and dance of the various countries.

**Junior Superstars**<br>
The Junior Superstars (JSS) is annual event which provides a platform for students to showcase their musical talents. It is in general a pop song singing competition with the allowance for students to accompany their singing with background music, live instruments or dance. JSS consists of four categories i.e. P3/4 Solo & Group and P5/6 Solo & Group. 

The finalists of the JSS are selected through an audition process. The JSS finals are presented live at our Performing Arts Hall and the student audience get to vote for their favourite performances. We celebrate the successes of our winners by awarding them with “Finalist” and “Student Choice” trophies for their efforts.

<b><u>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)</b></u><br>
With a wide array of CCAs, we provide every pupil with an opportunity for a meaningful experience. During the regular CCA sessions, pupils are encouraged to pursue excellence by striving for self-improvement and growth. Other than celebrating improvement in skills and knowledge, we also inculcate the necessary values and attitudes, which are essential in their preparation for future challenges. Please refer to [‘Our CCAs’](https://acsj.moe.edu.sg/our-ccas) for more information.
