Overview
========

The PE / CCA / Aesthetics Department seeks to cater to the holistic development of each pupil. We are committed to ensuring that our pupils receive a well-rounded education, and aim to create opportunities to uncover pupils' talents, develop their potential, build character, and cultivate a lifelong healthy and recreational interest through active participation. We equip them with desirable social attitudes as well as the skills and fortitude to meet present and future challenges.
