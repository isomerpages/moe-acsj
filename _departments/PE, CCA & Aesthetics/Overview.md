<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The PE and Aesthetics (Art and Music) Department seeks to cater to the
holistic development of each student. We are committed to ensuring that
our students receive a well-rounded education and aim to create opportunities
to uncover studentsâ€™ talents, develop their potential, build character,
and cultivate a lifelong healthy and recreational interest through active
participation. We equip them with desirable social attitudes as well as
the skills and fortitude to meet present and future challenges.</p>
