#### IN DAYS OF YORE

Founded in 1885, the Methodist Church in Singapore (MCS) is the largest Protestant denomination in Singapore. With 46 churches, 15 schools, missions, and welfare agencies, MCS seeks to share the love of God and serve Him through the reaching out of people in the different stages of their lives, who may speak different languages and have different needs. Since its founding, MCS has contributed significantly to nation building especially in the areas of education and community work.

#### CAIRNHILL METHODIST CHURCH

The seed was sown on 23 January 1994, at the Centennial Thanksgiving Service of Kampong Kapor Methodist Church (KKMC) when KKMC members were challenged to step out of their comfort zones and consider planting a new preaching point.

In 1995, 15 brave KKMC members pursued that vision with great intensity and passion. A year later, on 6 October 1996, the first worship service was held at Cairnhill Chapel, a new preaching point located in Anglo-Chinese School (Junior).

Cairnhill Methodist Church was constituted as the&nbsp;**17th Church**&nbsp;in&nbsp;**TRAC**&nbsp;on&nbsp;**4th October 1998**. Rev Peter Goh from KKMC was appointed as the founding pastor.

**Today, Cairnhill Methodist Church continues to be a close partner and supporter of Anglo-Chinese School (Junior).**
