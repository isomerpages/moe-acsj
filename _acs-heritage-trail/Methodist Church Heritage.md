#### IN DAYS OF YORE

Founded in 1885, the Methodist Church in Singapore (MCS) is the largest Protestant denomination in Singapore. With 46 churches, 15 schools, missions, and welfare agencies, MCS seeks to share the love of God and serve Him through the reaching out of people in the different stages of their lives, who may speak different languages and have different needs. Since its founding, MCS has contributed significantly to nation building especially in the areas of education and community work.
