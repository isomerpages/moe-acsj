The ACSian Thinker and Joyful Learner responds in the learning process, articulating his learning in visible forms.

He shares his reflection, influences others positively and displays products to demonstrate his learning. His engagement in learning is seen in the motivation to acquire deep knowledge, and his own fulfilment. He understands the value of what he is learning and his strengths and interest are developed. The whole learning process brings him joy.
