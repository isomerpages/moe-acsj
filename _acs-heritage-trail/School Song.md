## OUR ACS FOREVER

<img align="left" style="width:48%" src="/images/schsong.jpg">

**Mr Henry Martyn Hoisington**&nbsp;composed the lyrics of the well-loved ACS Anthem which is sung to the tune of "The Maple Leaf Forever" in 1926. An old boy of ACS, HM Hoisington joined ACS in 1909 and taught Mathematics, Literature and English Language. Teaching was his life. A born teacher, with the power to stimulate his students intellectually, his idealism transcended the classroom.
