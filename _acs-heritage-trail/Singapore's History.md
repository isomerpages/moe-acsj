On opening day, 13 sons of Chinese businessmen started school in a rented shophouse at No. 70 Amoy Street. Although it was known officially as "Anglo-Chinese School", it was also known as “Oldham Mission School” by the man-in-the-street.

**ACS STORIES DURING WAR TIME**

"The boys at Cairnhill were told to economise… So the boys are resorting to extremely small handwriting in order to save valuable paper. Only the hawkers in the tiffin shed are not cursing the war… They are secretly hoping that it will continue for some time yet because the boys have economised in regard to paper, concerts and bus fares, only to spend more in the tiffin shed." - As told by Cecil Wong in&nbsp;_Hearts, Hopes &amp; Aims_
