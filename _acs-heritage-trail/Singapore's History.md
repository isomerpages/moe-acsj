**THE BEGINNING OF ACS**

The school opened its doors on 1 March 1886 at 70 Amoy Street.

On opening day, 13 sons of Chinese businessmen started school in a rented shophouse at No. 70 Amoy Street. Although it was known officially as "Anglo-Chinese School", it was also known as “Oldham Mission School” by the man-in-the-street.
