On opening day, 13 sons of Chinese businessmen started school in a rented shophouse at No. 70 Amoy Street. Although it was known officially as "Anglo-Chinese School", it was also known as “Oldham Mission School” by the man-in-the-street.

**ACS STORIES DURING WAR TIME**

"The boys at Cairnhill were told to economise… So the boys are resorting to extremely small handwriting in order to save valuable paper. Only the hawkers in the tiffin shed are not cursing the war… They are secretly hoping that it will continue for some time yet because the boys have economised in regard to paper, concerts and bus fares, only to spend more in the tiffin shed." - As told by Cecil Wong in&nbsp;_Hearts, Hopes &amp; Aims_

#### 1949

Primary and Middle schools at Coleman Street merged to become&nbsp;Anglo-Chinese Junior School.

#### 1951

The Junior School&nbsp;Split into 2 Campuses, with some classes at Coleman Street and 6 standards at Barker Road.

One of the first things the school did upon its move to Barker Road in 1951 was to organise a Combined Concert with the Junior School at Coleman Street. This celebration of the move was followed by a big party to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952. Festivities included processions, fireworks and parties.

Life for the Barker Road Juniors revolved around studies, examinations, sports, chapel services, and food and fun in the tuckshop.

<p align="right"> <b>ACS BEYOND THE TEXTBOOK</b> <br>"Of the visual aids used in schools, excursions are probably the most valuable because they deal with things in their natural situations. Every trip supplements the class instruction. We take the classroom to the museum, to the factory, or to a municipal department where the pupils may obtain first-hand contact with the subject under study." - Mr Ang Cheng Kim,&nbsp;_ACS Magazine_&nbsp;circa 1950s</p>

<p align="right"> <b>1955</b> <br>With the&nbsp;Change of Nomenclature of class levels, Coleman Street held Primary 1 to 5 classes, while Barker Road held Primary 1 to 6 classes. In the following year, both campuses functioned as six-level Primary schools.

A unique experience awaited the boys when the school celebrated Founder's Day with pupils and teachers gathering under the "Old Mango Tree" as the auditorium was being used by the secondary school. This lack of space did not deter those in the school, but instead gave them the opportunity to celebrate in a unique setting.</p>
