**OLDHAM HOUSE**

<img align="left" style="width:49%" src="/images/bishop-oldam.jpg">

Oldham House was named after&nbsp;**Bishop William F Oldham**&nbsp;who founded ACS in 1886. His first tour of duty in Singapore lasted about five years and the Methodist Mission was well and truly established when he left Singapore. Poor health forced him to return to America. In 1926, he and his wife visited Singapore and participated in the 40th anniversary of the School, and again in 1935 at the Golden Jubilee of the Methodist Mission.

Thoburn House was named after&nbsp;**Bishop Dr James Thoburn**. He was responsible for initiating and accompanying the pioneer mission to Singapore. He (and Bishop Oldham) were responsible in the setting up of the Methodist Church as a Mission in Singapore in 1885. Bishop Dr Thoburns vision (and Bishop Oldham) made possible the birth of ACS. Had it not been for him, there might not have been an ACS.

It was his personal initiative as an important leader in the Methodist Conference in India that resulted in the planting of the first Methodist Church in Singapore in 1885.</p>
