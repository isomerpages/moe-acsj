<p><strong>OLDHAM HOUSE</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:49%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/bishop-oldam.jpg">
</div>
<p>Oldham House was named after&nbsp;<strong>Bishop William F Oldham</strong>&nbsp;who
founded ACS in 1886. His first tour of duty in Singapore lasted about five
years and the Methodist Mission was well and truly established when he
left Singapore. Poor health forced him to return to America. In 1926, he
and his wife visited Singapore and participated in the 40th anniversary
of the School, and again in 1935 at the Golden Jubilee of the Methodist
Mission.

<p><strong>THOBURN HOUSE</strong>

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:49%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/bishop-thoburn.jpg">
</div>
<p>Thoburn House was named after&nbsp;<strong>Bishop Dr James Thoburn</strong>.
He was responsible for initiating and accompanying the pioneer mission
to Singapore. He (and Bishop Oldham) were responsible in the setting up
of the Methodist Church as a Mission in Singapore in 1885. Bishop Dr Thoburns
vision (and Bishop Oldham) made possible the birth of ACS. Had it not been
for him, there might not have been an ACS.</p>
<p>It was his personal initiative as an important leader in the Methodist
Conference in India that resulted in the planting of the first Methodist
Church in Singapore in 1885.</p>

<p><strong>Rev Goh Hood Keng</strong>&nbsp;was one of the most remarkable
ACSians. He taught for about 20 years in ACS and distinguished himself
as one of the most esteemed teachers of the school. He was the first Singaporean
ordained Methodist Minister. As a minister of the Methodist Church, he
pastured the Straits Chinese Methodist Church (Kampong Kapor Methodist
Church) for nearly 40 years until he retired in 1952. As a preacher, Bishop
Doraisamy considered him a “legend before his time”. Combining his gift
of teaching with that of preaching was perhaps why the School named one
of the Houses after him.</p>

civic leader with an impeccable record of public service to Singapore,
Tan Sri Tan Chin Tuan was well-known for his integrity and compassion.

early pioneers.</p>
