Our school's history is rich and exciting. The following timeline provides you a visual representation of the ACSian story from one school with 13 boys to the thriving 7 schools that we are today.

7 FEBRUARY 1885<br>
ARRIVAL IN SINGAPORE

Upon arriving in Singapore, Rev Oldham was struck by the sight of the many Chinese boys roaming the streets of Chinatown. One day, while on a stroll along one of the Chinatown streets, he came across a signboard bearing the caption&nbsp;**"The Celestial Reasoning Association"**

#### LECTURE ON ASTRONOMY

Rev Oldham was invited to give a lecture on astronomy to Chinese businessmen at the club dinner. The next morning,&nbsp;**Rev Oldham received a request from a member of the Singapore Legislative Council â€” Mr Tan, to be his English Tutor.**&nbsp;Rev Oldham accepted the appointment and soon, Mr Tan began to "make finer English speeches than he had been thought capable of."

Word of the success of Rev Oldham's English lessons started to spread. Rev Oldham was asked to be an English Tutor to several of the members who had attended his lecture. However,&nbsp;**Rev Oldham turned them down and offered to teach their sons instead**. The Chinese businessmen accepted this proposal and thus opened the door for Rev Oldham to begin classes for boys from influential Chinese circles.

1 MARCH 1886<br>
AMOY STREET

A handbill was posted advertising Rev Oldham's classes.&nbsp;**On the 1st of March 1886, the Anglo-Chinese School opened with 13 sons of these Chinese businessmen.**&nbsp;The school opened its doors in a rented shophouse on 70 Amoy Street.

Among the first pupils to be enrolled were Koh Kim Beng, Ong Soon Tee, Lim Tay Bee, Tan Cheng Tit and Tan Cheng Kee.

15 NOVEMBER 1886<br>
COLEMAN STREET

The school&nbsp;**moved to Coleman Street on 15 November 1886**. 28 names made up the first roll at Coleman Street.

The first building was erected at an expense of about $4,000. The new building had two storeys and a "footprint" of approximately 22.6m x 18.3m.

The building was the&nbsp;**home of the pastor-principal**, and also a&nbsp;**chapel**, a&nbsp;**boarding school**&nbsp;and a&nbsp;**day school**. The first staff of teachers consisted of Rev Oldham, Mrs Oldham, Mr Webb and Madden with a few local helpers.

In July 1893, a new front section was built with a grant of $3,000. This allowed the school to&nbsp;**double its capacity to 400 pupils housed under one roof.**

It was also at Coleman Street that the seeds which later bloomed into Oldham Hall and Nind Home were sown. Here, Rev Oldham took in students whose parents needed help caring for them while they were out of town.

1 APRIL 1897<br>
BELLEVUE

Soon, the premises at Coleman Street were overtaxed and $12,000 was raised with the help of&nbsp;**Mr Tan Jiak Kim**&nbsp;for the purchase of Bellevue, an old bungalow situated at the end of Oldham Lane. By 1 April 1897, the new Bellevue premises were completed. Bellevue served as missionary quarters and the boarding department for the next few years.

In 1896, Rev Kelso, the School Principal, decided on the name "Bellevue" for the boys' boarding house.

14 DECEMBER 1926<br>
DUNEARN HOUSE

In 1925, the Methodist Church purchased Dunearn House from Mdm Tan Teck Neo, the widow of Mr Lee Choon Guan, to house missionaries and students of Anglo-Chinese School.

On 14 December 1926, the Rev and Mrs F. H. Sullivan, together with the Oldham Hall boys,&nbsp;**marched from the "Bellevue" location to their new home at "Dunearn House", at Barker Road.**

1928-1950<br>
CAIRNHILL

As enrolment continued to grow steadily, the&nbsp;**premises at Coleman Street were once again congested**. It was initially proposed that a new primary school be built at Oldham Lane. However, soil conditions were not favourable for the construction of a concrete building.

As such, the building at Cairnhill was&nbsp;**purchased for approximately $115,000.**&nbsp;This sum was raised through a campaign run by Rev Peach. Some of the principal donors of this sum were the Government, Mr Lim Peng Siang, Mr Tan Chin Tuan and Mr Tan Kah Kee.

The building was designed in a "semi-Chinese style" and was described as "unusual in appearance but very attractive". The new building was&nbsp;**officially opened on 17 November 1928.**
