7 FEBRUARY 1885<br>
ARRIVAL IN SINGAPORE

Upon arriving in Singapore, Rev Oldham was struck by the sight of the many Chinese boys roaming the streets of Chinatown. One day, while on a stroll along one of the Chinatown streets, he came across a signboard bearing the caption&nbsp;**"The Celestial Reasoning Association"**

#### LECTURE ON ASTRONOMY

Rev Oldham was invited to give a lecture on astronomy to Chinese businessmen at the club dinner. The next morning,&nbsp;**Rev Oldham received a request from a member of the Singapore Legislative Council â€” Mr Tan, to be his English Tutor.**&nbsp;Rev Oldham accepted the appointment and soon, Mr Tan began to "make finer English speeches than he had been thought capable of."

Word of the success of Rev Oldham's English lessons started to spread. Rev Oldham was asked to be an English Tutor to several of the members who had attended his lecture. However,&nbsp;**Rev Oldham turned them down and offered to teach their sons instead**. The Chinese businessmen accepted this proposal and thus opened the door for Rev Oldham to begin classes for boys from influential Chinese circles.

A handbill was posted advertising Rev Oldham's classes.&nbsp;**On the 1st of March 1886, the Anglo-Chinese School opened with 13 sons of these Chinese businessmen.**&nbsp;The school opened its doors in a rented shophouse on 70 Amoy Street.

Among the first pupils to be enrolled were Koh Kim Beng, Ong Soon Tee, Lim Tay Bee, Tan Cheng Tit and Tan Cheng Kee.

The school&nbsp;**moved to Coleman Street on 15 November 1886**. 28 names made up the first roll at Coleman Street.

The building was the&nbsp;**home of the pastor-principal**, and also a&nbsp;**chapel**, a&nbsp;**boarding school**&nbsp;and a&nbsp;**day school**. The first staff of teachers consisted of Rev Oldham, Mrs Oldham, Mr Webb and Madden with a few local helpers.

In July 1893, a new front section was built with a grant of $3,000. This allowed the school to&nbsp;**double its capacity to 400 pupils housed under one roof.**

It was also at Coleman Street that the seeds which later bloomed into Oldham Hall and Nind Home were sown. Here, Rev Oldham took in students whose parents needed help caring for them while they were out of town.
