PSLE Matters
============

**FAQS on PSLE**

 Q1.   When do I choose the secondary school of my choice?
 
The selection of secondary school can be made after the release of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) Results. The S1 Internet System (S1-IS) opens for 24-hour online submission at 11am on the day of the PSLE results release. Parents and students can submit their 6 preferred school choices within the next 7 calendar days.

Here are the steps:

*   Your child will receive a personalised [**S1 Option Form and Eligibility Letter**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting/school-choices/get-option-form) along with their PSLE results.
*   Discuss secondary school options with your child. The [**courses**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/courses/) and [**schools**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/schools/) available to your child will depend on their PSLE results. Then, complete the S1 Option Form.
*   Use the S1 Option Form to prepare the information required for the online submission.
*   [**Submit your child's choices**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting/school-choices/submit-option-form), either through the S1 Internet System or through your child’s primary school.

Q2.   What is the Affiliation Priority under the New PSLE Scoring and S1 Posting System?  

a) There is no change to the affiliation policy in the new 2021 PSLE system. 

b) Affiliated students are eligible for affiliation priority if they

*   Meet the affiliate minimum requirements (AMR) set by the secondary school; and
*   Indicate the affiliated secondary school as their first choice at S1 Posting.
c) Affiliation priority and meeting the AMRs do not guarantee admission into the affiliated secondary school  

*   It is subject to the availability of vacancies in the school, and
*   If the demand from affiliates exceeds the available vacancies for affiliates, they will be posted by merit based on their PSLE scores.

d) Affiliated secondary schools will continue to reserve 20% of the places in each course (Express/N(A)/N(T)) for students who do not benefit from affiliation priority.  
  
e) For secondary schools that offer both O-level and Integrated Programme (IP), affiliation priority will only be given for the O-Level track.  Students are eligible for affiliation priority if they indicate:  
  
f) For the ACS family, where the primary school affiliates have two secondary schools, affiliation will only be given for the ACS(I) O Level Programme and ACS (Barker) if you opt one of the following ways:

Q3.   What are the Affiliate Minimum Requirements (AMRs) in Achievement Level (AL) terms?

a)   As we transit to a new scoring system, MOE has generated the indicative PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary schools from students’ PSLE results and school choice patterns at the 2020 S1 Posting Exercise.

b)   MOE has generated the AMR(s) in AL terms to reflect similar academic standards to the existing T-score AMRs that were set by the school.  The intention is to maintain the same standards that affiliates need to meet in order to be eligible for affiliation priority during S1 Posting.

c)The AMR(s) and indicative PSLE ranges of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) for the coming 2021 Posting exercises are:

4.How to choose a secondary school that is suitable for your child?

a)Here is how to help your child match the school to their strengths and interests.

**ASK**: What are their strengths, interests and abilities?

*   What kind of course, programmes and opportunities will develop these?
*   Will the pace of learning be suitable for them?

**CONSIDER**:

*   School Culture
*   Courses
*   Programmes, Subjects and CCAs offered
*   Location and Transport
*   If your child has Special Educational Needs, select schools with specialised facilities or resources.

**SUBMIT**:

*   6 School Options
*   So that your child is more likely to get into a school of choice.
*   Schools with Different Cut-Off Points
*   Consider at least 2-3 schools where your child’s PSLE Score is better than the school’s Cut-Off Point.

b)   Your ranking of school choices matters.

The higher you rank your preferred school in your choice order, the better your child’s chance of being posted there if there is a tie-breaker.

c)   Do note that school’s PSLE Score ranges can vary year to year, since they depend on each cohort’s performance and choice patterns.
