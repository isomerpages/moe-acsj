<h1>General Information</h1>

<p>How do I assist as a Parent Volunteer?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For parents whose sons are already enrolled in the School, the Principal
annually sends out a form inviting parents to participate in various parent
support groups. Parents may choose to sign-up using the form. Alternatively,
parents may visit this website on the Parent Support Group and speak with
the co-ordinators of the various groups to find out more about their activities.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>My son has the same teacher for most of his subjects, is this good?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All primary school teachers are generalists. Although there is specialisation
of teaching, this is done mostly at the upper levels. At the lower primary
levels, it is helpful to have a teacher teach the class more than one subject.
This provides a sense of stability for the child and teachers can provide
more nurturing as they would get to know the child better.&nbsp;</p>
