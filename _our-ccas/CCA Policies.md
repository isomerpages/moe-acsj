<h3>Overview &amp; Policies</h3>
<p>CCA is an integral part of our pupils’ holistic education. The main aim
of CCA is character-building. In ACS(J), we intentionally teach the School
Values of Integrity, Loyalty, Love, Curiosity, Collaboration and Excellence.
Through CCA, we also create shared experiences for our ACSians to develop
their self-identity, and to deepen their sense of belonging and rootedness
to the school. While they learn and improve their skills, we hope to ignite
their passion for learning, beyond exams and competitions, as they move
on to embrace the challenges of 21st-century living.
