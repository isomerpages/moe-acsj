CCA is an integral part of our pupils’ holistic education.  
  
The main aim of CCA is character-building. In ACS(J), we intentionally teach the School Values of Integrity, Loyalty, Love, Curiosity, Collaboration and Excellence.  
  
Through CCA, we also create shared experiences for our ACSians to develop their self-identity, and to deepen their sense of belonging and rootedness to the school.  
  
While they learn and improve their skills, we hope to ignite their passion for learning, beyond exams and competitions, as they move on to embrace the challenges of 21st-century living.  
  
<b><u>PROGRAMME</u></b><br> 

1\.  In line with MOE direction, Program for Active Learning (PAL) is integrated during timetabled curriculum hours for Primary 1 and Primary 2 students to provide a platform for holistic development and to nurture their character. this lays the foundation for their social competencies, should they decide to participate in a CCA from Primary 3 onwards.<br>
2\.  From Primary 3 onwards, students have the option to register for a CCA programme that will take place after school.<br>
3\.  The programme provides year-round involvement and allows for a systematic development of our pupil's interests and abilities.<br>
4\.  Other than PAL and CCA, the school has level-wide experiences, such as Brazilian Samba Drumming, Ceramics, Tennis and Rugby, integrated into the curriculum through to provide an enriching 6-year experience for the students.
