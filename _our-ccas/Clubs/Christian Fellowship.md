<h3>Christian Fellowship</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Christian Fellowship(CF) aims to provide a safe haven for pupils to ask
questions about God, experience personal spiritual revival and be equipped
to worship and witness for Christ. Through it all, we hope to build godly
character and foster love among its members, to become a worshipful community
that pray for and serve ACS Junior, the nation and the world.</p>
<p>Membership is open to all Pri.3 to Pri.6 pupils, as their first or second
CCA, since it is held on a different day as most other CCA.</p>

<p>The programme is designed to expose pupils to the wonders of God’s goodness
through His manifold attributes, so they can freely respond and grow in
faith, hope and love.
<br>Activities include praise and worship, Bible studies followed by discussions,
role play, prayer, video screening and art and craft. There are also opportunities
to learn how to play the ukulele and participate to lead singing and prayer
at our school chapel.</p>
