### Christian Fellowship

#### Overview

Christian Fellowship(CF) aims to provide a safe haven for pupils to ask questions about God, experience personal spiritual revival and be equipped to worship and witness for Christ. Through it all, we hope to build godly character and foster love among its members, to become a worshipful community that pray for and serve ACS Junior, the nation and the world.

  

Membership is open to all Pri.3 to Pri.6 pupils, as their first or second CCA, since it is held on a different day as most other CCA.
