### Chess Club

#### Overview

Chess is a combination of strategy, style and basic skills. Just as each person is unique, a pupil develops his chess identity over time. Playing regularly with some guidance along the way helps to correctly mould a pupil's game and shape it into a style of his own in his pursuit of excellence.

  

The Chess Club is open to all chess enthusiasts from Pri.3 to Pri.6.&nbsp;Members learn to write chess notations, chess tactics and strategies and get a chance to challenge their peers. Mini-tournaments are held within the club to rank and select the players. Selected players will then represent the school in individual and team championships at the inter-school level.
