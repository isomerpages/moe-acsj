<h3>Chess Club</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Chess is a combination of strategy, style and basic skills. Just as each
person is unique, a pupil develops his chess identity over time. Playing
regularly with some guidance along the way helps to correctly mould a pupil's
game and shape it into a style of his own in his pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>The Chess Club is open to all chess enthusiasts from Pri.3 to Pri.6.&nbsp;Members
learn to write chess notations, chess tactics and strategies and get a
chance to challenge their peers. Mini-tournaments are held within the club
to rank and select the players. Selected players will then represent the
school in individual and team championships at the inter-school level.</p>
