### Chinese Club

#### Overview

The aims and objectives of the Chinese Club are to help the members to develop mentally and physically in a fun learning environment rich in a variety of rewarding and carefully planned experiences.

  

The Chinese Club is open to Pri.3 to Pri.6 pupils who are keen on pursuing their common interest in Chinese Culture and Art. Apart from honing the members’ linguistic skills and literary knowledge of the Chinese Language, the members are able to unleash their creativity by exploring and practising the art of Chinese brush painting.

  

Through learning about the culture which triggers the interest and love of a language, the members will also learn intrinsic qualities such as commitment, perseverance and teamwork.
