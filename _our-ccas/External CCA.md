<p><strong><u>Notice on External Activity Records</u></strong>
</p>
<p>With effect from this year (2025), please be informed that the school
will no longer accept or record students' participation in external activities¹.
Parents are encouraged to maintain a personal portfolio of their child’s
non-school-based activities and achievements.</p>
<p>For the purpose of Direct School Admission (DSA), parents may submit their
child’s non-school-based activities and achievements via the DSA portal
when their child is in Primary Six, for up to 10 entries. Your child's
primary school information will automatically be shared with the applied
DSA-Sec school(s), except for the School of the Arts (SOTA) and the Singapore
Sports School, as these schools handle direct admissions independently.</p>
<p>Please refer to the following link for more information on the DSA application
portal: <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa/application" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa/application</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact:</p>
