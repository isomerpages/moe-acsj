CCA POLICIES
============

**Objectives**

![](/images/Sports08.png)

CCA is an integral part of our pupils’ holistic education.  
  
The main aim of CCA is character-building. In ACS(J), we intentionally teach the School Values of Integrity, Loyalty, Love, Curiosity, Collaboration and Excellence.  
  
Through CCA, we also create shared experiences for our ACSians to develop their self-identity, and to deepen their sense of belonging and rootedness to the school.  
  
While they learn and improve their skills, we hope to ignite their passion for learning, beyond exams and competitions, as they move on to embrace the challenges of 21st-century living.  
  
**PROGRAMME**  
  

1.  The CCA programme offers a wide range of activities and caters for the varied interests and abilities of our pupils.
2.  The programme provides year-round involvement and allows for a systematic development of our pupil's interests and abilities.
3.  The programme includes participatory (intra-school) and competitive (inter-school) activities. The former enables the active involvement of all pupils. The latter gives our pupils the opportunity to experience competition and motivates them to further pursue their passion.
4.  Pupils are allotted to the various Houses: Oldham (OLD), Thoburn (THO), Tan Kah Kee (TKK), Goh Hood Keng (GHK), Cheong Koon Seng (CKS), Lee Seng Gee (LSG), Shaw Vee Meng (SVM) and Tan Chin Tuan (TCT). Representation at the school's Annual Track and Field and Swimming Championships is on the inter-House basis.
5.  In line with MOE direction, Program for Active Learning (PAL) is integrated during curriculum hours for Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils to provide a platform for holistic development and to nurture their character.

  
**PARTICIPATION**  

1.  Most CCAs are open to Pri.3 to Pri.6 pupils. Please refer to the school website for specific CCA details.
2.  Pri.3 to Pri.6 pupils are strongly encouraged to take part in one CCA, which could be a uniformed group, a club, a performing arts group or a sport.
3.  Pupils are encouraged to participate in one CCA. They may participate in a second CCA if there are vacancies but it should be a less demanding activity to ensure that they do not have too heavy a CCA load and that they have enough rest time.
4.  Pupils can register for a new CCA at the beginning of the new year and are encouraged to stay in that CCA for the whole year. However, pupils may opt to change their CCA in the middle of the year on medical grounds.
5.  Attendance is compulsory at every CCA session. A medical certificate or a letter from the parent is necessary if the pupil is absent. Pupils who are present for at least 75% of their CCA sessions will have their CCA reflected in their Report Book.
6.  Pri.6 pupils have the option to stand down from their CCA from Term 3 onwards.

  

**EXTERNAL CCA**

  

1.  While the boys may be able to develop their skills externally, there are aspects of character building and sense of belonging that may be unique to our school CCAs. ACSians are encouraged to take part in a CCA in school as much as possible.
2.  If you still wish for your son’s External CCA to be recognised as an External CCA, please submit an official letter from the club/association via the External CCA registration link **[https://tinyurl.com/acsjextcca](https://tinyurl.com/acsjextcca)**, by 24 January 2022, stipulating their training days and times.
3.  External Sports CCA has to be sanctioned by the Singapore School Sports Council at the Primary (e.g. Taekwondo, Gymnastics) or Secondary level (e.g. Fencing, Squash). Please refer to [**https://nsg.moe.edu.sg/sssc**](https://nsg.moe.edu.sg/sssc) for the list of recognized sports. Other sports not offered by SSSC but has a National Sports Association recognized by Singapore Sports Council may also be recognized. If the request is not approved, the Subject Head (CCA) will contact the boys within a week.
4.  Sports offered at NSG (Primary) will be recognized as school representation, even if it is not a school CCA e.g. Taekwondo, Track & Field. All other competitions that require school endorsement for participation are to be approved by HOD.
5.  Students who specialize in sports not offered at NSG (Primary) will be allowed to represent the school in one official tournament. Approval by HOD is necessary.

  

**DEPLOYMENT**

Teachers’ competencies, expertise and interests are taken into consideration when they are deployed into the various CCAs. The deployment also ensures that each CCA has at least one experienced teacher who has been in the CCA before. This ensures that the experienced teacher has the knowledge and skills for the smooth running of the CCA and is also able to guide and mentor the new or beginning teachers.  
  
**VENUES**

Most CCAs will be held within the school premises with the exception of a few sports which require external facilities specific to the sport.
