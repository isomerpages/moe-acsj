<h3>Badminton</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Badminton has always been a popular CCA, but due to space constraints,
membership is limited and priority is given to present members who are
continuing with the CCA the following year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCA will train members in the rules of the game, fundamental skills
and strategies for playing the game, and to reach a desirable level of
fitness to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. The CCA also aims to
develop sportsmanship, discipline, teamwork and a love of the game in its
members.</p>
