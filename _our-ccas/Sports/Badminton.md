### Badminton

#### Overview

  

Badminton has always been a popular CCA, but due to space constraints, membership is limited and priority is given to present members who are continuing with the CCA the following year. &nbsp;

The CCA will train members in the rules of the game, fundamental skills and strategies for playing the game, and to reach a desirable level of fitness to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. The CCA also aims to develop sportsmanship, discipline, teamwork and a love of the game in its members.
