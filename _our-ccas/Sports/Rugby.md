### Rugby

#### Overview

  

Rugby has always been a big part of ACS culture. Experiencing values such as solidarity, integrity, passion, discipline and respect in a team setting allows them to develop their character. The challenging nature of the game builds their resilience and prepares them for future challenges.  


The Rugby CCA is open to pupils who are keen to learn the game and build camaraderie amongst their peers. Training is twice a week for training squad members and once a week for non-competitive ruggers.

Members who are ready will be selected for the training squad and be equipped with the necessary game knowledge and skills. They may have opportunities to represent the school in various platforms such as ad-hoc carnivals, Zonal and National Primary School tournaments.
