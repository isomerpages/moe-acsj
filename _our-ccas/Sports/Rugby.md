<h3>Rugby</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Rugby has always been a big part of ACS culture. Experiencing values such
as solidarity, integrity, passion, discipline and respect in a team setting
allows them to develop their character. The challenging nature of the game
builds their resilience and prepares them for future challenges.</p>
<p>The Rugby CCA is open to pupils who are keen to learn the game and build
camaraderie amongst their peers. Training is twice a week for training
squad members and once a week for non-competitive ruggers.</p>
<p>Members who are ready will be selected for the training squad and be equipped
with the necessary game knowledge and skills. They may have opportunities
to represent the school in various platforms such as friendly games and
National School Games.</p>
