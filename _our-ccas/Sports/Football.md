### Football

#### Overview

Football is a popular game with the pupils. We have a football training programme that caters to pupils who have a love of the game. The club aims to equip the pupils with knowledge of the principles of the game, team and individual skills and inculcate in them sportsmanship, discipline, teamwork, integrity and other positive character traits. Regular physical conditioning sessions are also included to boost the pupils’ fitness level.

  

Friendly matches with other teams are arranged periodically so as to promote understanding among the players in their various roles. The school team takes part in the annual Zonal tournament, in both the Senior and Junior Divisions, and if they perform well, they proceed to the National Primary Schools tournament.
