### Sailing

Being able to sail your own little boat is a BIG achievement. Many children are now taking the bold step of learning how to sail the Optimist and the fact that children can sail on their own shows how easy and safe sailing can be.

  

Young sailors learn discipline, independence, team spirit, problem-solving, decision-making and many other traits that are essential in life besides skills that are needed to sail their boats. It is an all-rounded activity and is a sport that will last a lifetime.

  

Prior to NSG, the school will call for centralized training for sailors who train externally to join our school sailors.&nbsp;Pri. 3 to Pri. 5 pupils without prior experience may join ACSplore Sailing to start their Opti-Junior / Opti-Sailor journey.

  

Sailors who have already obtained their Opti-Racer certification may join ACScite Sailing for their Training Squad experience.
