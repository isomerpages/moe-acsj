<h2>Sailing</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Being able to sail your own little boat is a BIG achievement. Many children
are now taking the bold step of learning how to sail the Optimist and the
fact that children can sail on their own shows how easy and safe sailing
can be.</p>
<p>Young sailors learn discipline, independence, team spirit, problem-solving,
decision-making and many other traits that are essential in life besides
skills that are needed to sail their boats. It is an all-rounded activity
and is a sport that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Prior to NSG, the school will call for centralized training for sailors
who train externally to join our school sailors.&nbsp;Pri. 3 to Pri. 5
pupils without prior experience may join ACSplore Sailing to start their
Opti-Junior / Opti-Sailor journey.</p>
<p>Sailors who have already obtained their Opti-Racer certification may join
ACScite Sailing for their Training Squad experience.</p>

<p>• Boys have an option to register for Sailing as an External CCA.
<br>• Pupils will be placed in Junior, Green and White Fleet according to
their skill level.
<br>• Transport is provided to and from CCA venue. The CCA bus will leave
school at 2.00pm and return to school by 6.30pm. Parents need to arrange
their son’s own transport home from school.
<br>• Alternatively, parents can send their son to the CCA venue (by 2.30pm)
and/or pick up their son from the CCA venue (by 5.15pm).
<br>• Members are to meet the teachers in charge at the foyer by 1.50pm for
attendance taking. (Nearer to the Admin Block)
<br>• After the Sailing lesson, once the CCA bus arrives at 6pm at the CCA
venue, all pupils whose parents are not around will board the bus back
to school and parents will fetch their son from school around 6.15pm. No
pupils will be left alone at the CCA venue to wait for their parents without
an adult (you may ask your helper/boy's grandparents to accompany your
son until you pick them up).
<br>• All confirmed members will receive an official email with information
about the training schedule from the CCA teachers by late January.
<br>• If a pupil is absent, an email/ letter of excuse or a medical certificate
is required.
<br>• There will be no make-up or refund due to bad weather conditions or
haze or if a pupil is absent</p>
