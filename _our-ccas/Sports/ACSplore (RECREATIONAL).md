<h4>ACSPLORE FAQ</h4>
<p><strong>1) Will my son be doing the same two sports in the subsequent years?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>As the Modular Sports programme aims to provide exposure, we do not encourage
boys to repeat the same sport module.</p>
<p><strong>2) Will my son have the opportunity to move to ACScite in the subsequent years?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Ongoing observation will be done by teachers and coaches during the ACSplore
programme. If your son is observed to be ready, recommendation will be
made for him to specialize in a specific ACScite sport. P3 to P5 boys may
be recommended to move from ACSplore to ACScite if the coaches and teachers
see that they are ready.</p>
<p><strong>3) Will my son get to choose his sports for ACSplore?</strong>&nbsp;
Your son may list two choices for each category
<br>e.g. Individual Sport - 1st choice Table Tennis, 2nd choice Badminton
<br>Team Sport - 1st choice Hockey, 2nd choice Rugby.&nbsp;
<br>We will do our best to allocate your son one of his two choices.</p>
<p><strong>4) Can my son skip the ACSplore phase and go straight into ACScite?</strong>
<br>No. All boys must have gone through ACSplore for at least a year before
the coaches/teachers recommend them to go into ACScite.&nbsp; Exceptions
are made for boys who are selected for the national youth squad that is
run by the official National Sports Association.</p>
<p><strong>5) When will the ACSplore sessions be held?</strong>
<br>These sessions will last 1.5 hour and will be held on Mon, Wed, Thu or
Fri any time between 2 to 6pm.</p>
