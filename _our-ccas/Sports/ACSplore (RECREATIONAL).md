ACSplore (RECREATIONAL)
=======================

### **Rationale**  
  
**ACSplore**&nbsp;is aligned with the national direction of :&nbsp;  

*   Preventing early specialization and burn-out in youth sports
*   Developing a strong foundation for broad-based development,
*   Reducing the stakes of competition

Instead of the Recreational Sports CCAs, ACS(J) will offer modular sports CCA programme to all Primary 3 to primary 5 pupils -&nbsp;ACSplore

#### ACSPLORE FAQ  

**1) Will my son be doing the same two sports in the subsequent years?**&nbsp;<br>
As the Modular Sports programme aims to provide exposure, we do not encourage boys to repeat the same sport module.

**2) Will my son have the opportunity to move to ACScite in the subsequent years?**&nbsp;<br>
Ongoing observation will be done by teachers and coaches during the ACSplore programme. If your son is observed to be ready, recommendation will be made for him to specialize in a specific ACScite sport. P3 to P5 boys may be recommended to move from ACSplore to ACScite if the coaches and teachers see that they are ready.

**3) Will my son get to choose his sports for ACSplore?**&nbsp;
Your son may list two choices for each category<br>
e.g. Individual Sport - 1st choice Table Tennis, 2nd choice Badminton<br>
Team Sport - 1st choice Hockey, 2nd choice Rugby.&nbsp;<br>
We will do our best to allocate your son one of his two choices.

**4) Can my son skip the ACSplore phase and go straight into ACScite?**<br>
No. All boys must have gone through ACSplore for at least a year before the coaches/teachers recommend them to go into ACScite.&nbsp; Exceptions are made for boys who are selected for the national youth squad that is run by the official National Sports Association.
 
**5) When will the ACSplore sessions be held?**<br>
These sessions will last 1.5 hour and will be held on Mon, Wed, Thu or Fri any time between 2 to 6pm.
