### Tennis

#### Overview

In the Tennis CCA at ACS Junior, we believe in excellence in achievement and character through Tennis. Our mission and goal is to equip all members with desirable social attitudes as well as the skills and fortitude to meet present and future challenges, whilst providing for healthy recreation.

While all ACSians go through LLP (Tennis) during PE lessons from P3 onwards, Tennis CCA is available from Primary 3 onwards as a module in ACSplore and Primary 5 onwards as a recreational CCA. The selection of School players is based on the skill level of the pupils. Pupils are taught according to their skill level, from Beginner to Intermediate, and then Advanced.
