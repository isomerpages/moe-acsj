### Swimming

#### Overview

Swimming has always been synonymous with ACS. Learning how to swim not only equips our pupils with a survival skill, it helps to inculcate intrinsic qualities such as honour, courage and determination in the pupils.  
  
The Swimming CCA is open to Pri.3 to Pri.6 pupils who are keen in not only learning how to swim but have the competitive spirit as well. Training is twice / thrice a week for competitive swimmers and once a week for beginners.
