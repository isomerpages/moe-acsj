<h3>Swimming</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Swimming has always been synonymous with ACS. Learning how to swim not
only equips our pupils with a survival skill, it helps to inculcate intrinsic
qualities such as honour, courage and determination in the pupils.</p>
<p>The Swimming CCA is open to Pri.3 to Pri.6 pupils who are keen in not
only learning how to swim but have the competitive spirit as well. Training
is once a week.</p>
