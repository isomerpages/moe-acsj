### Cadet Scouts

#### Overview

  

The Cadet Scouts Movement aims to develop good citizenship among our pupils through:&nbsp;  

*   observation, obedience and self-reliance
*   inculcation of loyalty, integrity and thoughtfulness towards others
*   teaching of services useful to the public and skills useful to themselves
*   promotion of physical and mental development.

Membership is open to pupils from Pri.3 and Pri.4. Activities include drills, knotting, games, hiking, camping and first-aid, as well as working on progress (gold, silver and bronze) and proficiency badges.&nbsp;(e.g. sportsmanship, book reader, young naturalist etc.)
