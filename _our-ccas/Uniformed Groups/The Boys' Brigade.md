### The Boys' Brigade

#### Overview

The Boys’ Brigade is the oldest uniformed youth group in the world and was formed in 1883 by Sir William Alexander Smith. The BB was brought to Singapore in 1930 by Mr. James Milner Fraser, CBE, who was an architect from Britain and a former member of the 23rd Aberdeen and 33rd London Companies.

  

The Object of The Boys' Brigade is the advancement of Christ's Kingdom among Boys and the promotion of habits of Obedience, Reverence, Discipline, Self-Respect and all that tends towards a true Christian Manliness, including integrity and love.

  

The text has remained the same except for addition in 1893 of the word obedience. In practice, the Object means:

  

*   To help Boys develop and grow in Christian character
*   To train Boys to become loyal and responsible citizens
*   To promote Boys’ physical fitness and develop their leadership potential
