<h3>The Boys' Brigade</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The Boys’ Brigade is the oldest uniformed youth group in the world and
was formed in 1883 by Sir William Alexander Smith. The BB was brought to
Singapore in 1930 by Mr. James Milner Fraser, CBE, who was an architect
from Britain and a former member of the 23rd Aberdeen and 33rd London Companies.</p>
<p>The Object of The Boys' Brigade is the advancement of Christ's Kingdom
among Boys and the promotion of habits of Obedience, Reverence, Discipline,
Self-Respect and all that tends towards a true Christian Manliness, including
integrity and love.</p>
<p>The text has remained the same except for addition in 1893 of the word
obedience. In practice, the Object means:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>To promote Boys’ physical fitness and develop their leadership potential</p>

<p>The Gold Award is the highest award a Junior BB Boy can aspire to. Boys
have to complete all six colour badges (white, green, purple, blue, red
and silver), have an attendance of at least 80% for two years, completed
at least 4 hours of CIP as a BB member and participated in The Juniors’
Adventure Quest (conducted by the BBHQ).
<br>
<br>In the BB there are the activities that we have at brigade (national)
level and that we are required to participate in. These are the Character
Quest, Juniors Adventure Quest, BB Week, BB CARES and BBSGB.
<br>
<br><strong>Character Quest (Competition) </strong>
<br>A group of Boys will be asked or selected to participate. A portion of
the Bible will be selected and the Boys will participate in a competition
that will test them on how well they have understood the chosen portion.
It is also a competition and the companies will be assessed on their performance.
<br>
<br><strong>Juniors Adventure Quest (Competition) </strong>
<br>P6 Boys who wish to be considered for the Gold badge must participate
in this activity. Through a series of adventure type quests (amazing race
style), Boys will be tested on what they have learnt in their time in the
BB. It is also a competition and the companies will be assessed on their
performance.
<br>
<br><strong>BB Week (Competition) </strong>
<br>Boys are given BB Week cards in order to solicit donations. Targets are
set to encourage the Boys to do their best. A portion of the funds collected
go to the BB and the rest goes to the company.
<br>
<br><strong>BB CARES</strong> 
<br>This is an activity that rallies BB Boys (and their community) to serve.
It is conducted over a week-end and involves the Boys working with a VWO.
More will be made known in due course.
<br>
<br><strong>BB Share-A-Gift </strong>
<br>This is a nation-wide BB initiative to collect food items for the needy.
In our company, we collect food items from the school and send them to
BBHQ sometime towards the end of the school year
<br>
<br><strong>BB Camp </strong>
<br>This is our annual camp which will be held in March.</p>

<p>BB members wear a uniform. Depending on the occasion, they will either
wear Full Uniform or Day Dress (BB shirt and shorts, white belt, name tag,
dark blue socks and black shoes) or Fatigue Dress (BB polo tee shirt, BB
shorts, name tag and school shoes).
<br>For new members, the 12J will arrange a day to go down to the BBHQ [105
Ganges Avenue S(169695)] to effect uniform purchases. Regular members can
also join in to go down to buy items. However, only new members will be
given a subsidy.
<br>Subsequently, BB members are expected to go on their own to purchase whatever
items they may need (as and when the need requires).</p>
