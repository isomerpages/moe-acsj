<h3>Concert Band</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The Concert Band aims to provide an enriching musical experience to interested
pupils, providing them with opportunities to learn an instrument and perform
collaboratively as a musical group, as well as develop their creativity
in their love of music.</p>
<p>Pupils are motivated and challenged with a wide selection of band music.
Pupils will develop critical listening skills and begin to think creatively
through musical expression. The Band will engage in frequent performances
in special assemblies, music exchanges and competitions as part of their
pursuit of excellence as a musical group. The CCA is open to pupils from
P2 to P6.</p>
