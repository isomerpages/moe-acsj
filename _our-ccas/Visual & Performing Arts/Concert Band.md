### Concert Band

#### Overview

  

The Concert Band aims to provide an enriching musical experience to interested pupils, providing them with opportunities to learn an instrument and perform collaboratively as a musical group, as well as develop their creativity in their love of music.

  

Pupils are motivated and challenged with a wide selection of band music. Pupils will develop critical listening skills and begin to think creatively through musical expression. The Band will engage in frequent performances in special assemblies, music exchanges and competitions as part of their pursuit of excellence as a musical group. The CCA is open to pupils from P2 to P6.
