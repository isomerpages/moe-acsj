### Choir

#### Overview

  

The Choir is open to all pupils who have a love and passion for singing. As a CCA, the Choir seeks to develop the boys’ confidence through performances in school and in public. During Choir practices, boys are taught vocal techniques and proper singing etiquette. They will learn self-discipline and teamwork and have opportunities to bless others with their talents through Community Involvement Programmes.
