<h3>Choir</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The Choir is open to all pupils who have a love and passion for singing.
As a CCA, the Choir seeks to develop the boys’ confidence through performances
in school and in public. During Choir practices, boys are taught vocal
techniques and proper singing etiquette. They will learn self-discipline
and teamwork and have opportunities to bless others with their talents
through Community Involvement Programmes.</p>
