<h3>Art Club</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The Art Club aims to develop patience, self-determination, curiosity,
creativity and love for Art in its members.</p>
<p>Membership is open to Pri.3 to Pri.6 pupils who like to create, draw and
paint. In Art Club, members are exposed to a variety of mediums and materials.
With the given opportunities to work as a team, they practice collaboration
and leadership skills.</p>
<p>Members will be given opportunities to participate in various Art competitions.
Through their performances in their weekly Art Club sessions and Art competitions,
they may be selected to participate in the nation-wide SYF Art Exhibition.
The Learning Journey excursion in Term 3 helps members in gaining wider
exposure as they will visit exhibitions and view galleries.</p>
