<h3>String Orchestra</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>ACS(J) String Orchestra aims to provide a fulfilling musical experience
for our students. With clear vision and direction, the orchestra is moving
towards the development of its own distinctive musical personality. We
will continue to explore the variety of the dynamic spectrum by blending
of tone and cultivate a mature musical collaborative character within each
section as well as between each section. Most importantly, we aim to provide
a platform for our young musicians to grow up as strong advocates in the
arena of performing arts.</p>
<p>To join the Orchestra, students must have at least a Grade 3 pass in ABRSM
or an equivalent qualification for Violin, Viola, Cello, or Double Bass.
Additionally, an audition is required for confirmation of membership. Those
who do not play any instrument but have the interest and love for music
may consider building up their music skills at an external music academy
in view of joining the orchestra in the future.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements for joining the Orchestra:</p>
<p>1. Pass in Grade 3 ABRSM or equivalent in one of the following instruments:
Violin, Viola, Cello or Double Bass.
<br>2. Students have to undergo an audition before confirmation of membership.</p>
