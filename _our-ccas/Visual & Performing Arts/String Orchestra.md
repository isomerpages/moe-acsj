### String Orchestra

#### Overview

  

ACS(J) String Orchestra aims to provide a fulfilling musical experience for our pupils. With clear vision and direction, the orchestra is moving towards the development of its own distinctive musical personality. We will continue to explore the variety of the dynamic spectrum by blending of tone and cultivate a mature musical collaborative character within each section as well as between each section. Most importantly, we aim to provide a platform for our young musicians to grow up as strong advocates in the arena of performing arts.

  

Pupils with violin, viola, cello and double bass background are welcome to sign up. The minimum requirement is a Grade 3 at ABRSM or equivalent for their respective instruments. For those who sign up for the CCA, an audition will be conducted before confirmation of membership. Those who do not play any instrument but have the interest and love for music may consider building up their music skills at an external music academy in view of joining the orchestra in the future.
