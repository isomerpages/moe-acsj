Junior Vibez (Dance Club)
=========================

### Overview

Junior Vibez is open to Pri.3 to Pri.5 new pupils who are interested and have a love and passion for dance. It is a platform for nurturing the aesthetic sensibilities of our pupils, which is in line with Singapore's vision of becoming a cultural hub.

  

They will be exposed to popping and locking (styles of street dance), which also focus on maintaining fitness. They will be able to explore their inner creative talents and experiment with different dance moves as they work towards excellence in dance, and their passion for the arts and cultural life will be nurtured.

  

Junior Vibezâ€™s extensive commitment to performance means that the members will find themselves involved in school performances and inter-school or national competitions throughout the year. Membership is subject to auditions.
