<h3>Junior Vibez (Dance Club)</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Junior Vibez is open to P3 to P5 new pupils who are interested and have
a love and passion for dance. It is a platform for nurturing the aesthetic
sensibilities of our pupils, which is in line with Singapore's vision of
becoming a cultural hub.</p>
<p>They will be exposed to popping and locking (styles of street dance),
which also focus on maintaining fitness. They will be able to explore their
inner creative talents and experiment with different dance moves as they
work towards excellence in dance, and their passion for the arts and cultural
life will be nurtured.</p>
<p>Junior Vibez’s extensive commitment to performance means that the members
will find themselves involved in school performances and inter-school or
national competitions throughout the year. Membership is subject to auditions.</p>
