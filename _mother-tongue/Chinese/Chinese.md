<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><strong>VISION</strong>
<br>To stimulate and bring out the flair of language in every student, by
leading them to reach their maximum potential; and to nurture the love
of Chinese in them.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION</strong>
<br>To provide and sustain a learning environment which brings out the maximum
potential of our pupils, strengthening both their English and Chinese languages,
and engage them to learn in an academically conducive environment.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights / Focus Area</strong>
<br>The Chinese department makes use of highly interactive resources to support
Chinese teachers in the teaching of daily lessons. Teachers adopts collaborative
teaching strategies and employ IT resources (for example Student Learning
Space, e-Zhishi learning resources) actively during lessons to enhance
their teaching. One of the key focus areas of our department is making
thinking visible. To achieve this, we adapt various thinking routines and
the UPAR Thinking Protocol, which systematically encourages students to
build their competencies in a structured manner. In addition, we emphasize
making learning relevant by creating opportunities for students to apply
what they learn in their daily lives. With carefully designed scaffolding,
students are supported to progressively develop and master skills in speaking,
reading, and writing. This approach ensures a holistic and practical learning
experience for every student.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum Differentiation to Meet Students' Learning Needs</strong>
</p>
<p>To meet the diverse learning needs of our students, we offer curriculum
differentiation through a range of programmes. For students who require
additional support and guidance, we offer the Mother Tongue Support Programme
(MTSP) and pull-out programmes. The MOE-led MTSP is a tailor-made initiative
designed to help students learn Chinese through interactive games and activities.
With smaller class sizes, teachers are able to provide more individualised
feedback to address each student's unique learning needs. For students
who excel at learning Chinese, we offer enrichment programmes to further
develop their skills. Students who meet the required criteria are given
the opportunity to refine and develop their Chinese language skills, empowering
them to reach their full potential.</p>
