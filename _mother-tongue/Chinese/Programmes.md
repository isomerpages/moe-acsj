<h1>Programmes</h1>
<p><strong><u>A. Chinese Reading Programme</u></strong>
<br><strong>1) Morning Chinese Book Reading Programme</strong>
<br>The Chinese Reading Programme is designed to nurture students’ interest
in reading Chinese texts and to help them develop the habit of reading
Chinese books from a young age. Through a range of carefully planned reading
experiences, students are guided to appreciate stories, build vocabulary
and develop confidence in using the language. These experiences support
students in becoming reflective and independent learners.</p>
<p><strong>2) Book Review Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Book Review Programme encourages students to respond to texts in both
guided and independent ways. During class-guided reading sessions, students
participate in creative activities such as making bookmarks, designing
book covers, drawing their favourite story characters and creating character
masks.</p>
<p>For independent reading, technology is thoughtfully integrated to support
self-directed learning. Students share their reflections using digital
platforms, design posters to introduce books and recommend good reads to
their peers. Selected pieces of students’ work are showcased on notice
boards and digital platforms, affirming effort and motivating students
to read more widely.</p>

<p><strong>B. Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong>
</p>
<p>The Chinese Language Department organises the annual Mother Tongue Fortnight
to promote the learning of Chinese through engaging and meaningful experiences.
Over a two-week period, students participate in a wide range of activities,
including drama performances, storytelling sessions for lower primary students,
library-based activities, book fairs and classroom reading activities.</p>
<p>Through drama and storytelling, students experience the language in interactive
and expressive ways, sparking interest in Chinese culture and strengthening
communication skills. During recess, students can take part in Chinese
games and watch Chinese animations in the library. Class-based activities
further enhance engagement and collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>C. Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES), also known as “文化随意门”,
is an initiative led by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning
(CPCLL). Through this programme, students are given opportunities to experience
Chinese cultural performances at public performing arts venues.</p>
<p>To deepen learning, themes from the performances are thoughtfully aligned
with students’ textbook content, enabling them to make meaningful connections
between classroom learning and real-life cultural experiences, and to broaden
their cultural perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>D. Oral Enrichment Programme for Primary 6 Students</strong>
</p>
<p>The Oral Enrichment Programme is specially designed to support selected
Primary 6 students in developing their oracy skills. Trained parent volunteers
conduct small-group oral practice sessions, providing students with additional
opportunities to practise spoken Chinese in a supportive and nurturing
environment.</p>
<p>This programme helps students gain confidence, improve articulation and
develop the ability to express their ideas clearly, supporting their overall
communication and interpersonal skills.</p>
<p><strong>E. Language &amp; Cultural Immersion to China</strong>
</p>
<p>Selected Primary 5 students participate in an overseas language and cultural
immersion programme to China. The programme aims to expose students to
the daily life and culture of their Chinese counterparts, while providing
authentic contexts for language use.</p>
<p>Students visit partner schools such as Qiao Yi Experimental Primary School
in Wuxi and, from 2025 onwards, Ming Qiang Elementary School in Shanghai.
Through school exchanges and interactions, students form friendships and
communicate in Chinese. Visits to cultural and historical sites in Wuxi,
Suzhou and Shanghai further enrich their learning experiences. Each year,
students also host visiting students from China, strengthening cross-cultural
understanding and global awareness.</p>
