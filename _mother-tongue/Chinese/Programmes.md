Over two weeks, there will be a series of activities such as Drama House performances, Storytelling for lower Primary students, library activities, book fairs and reading activities conducted in class. Chinese Drama and Story-Telling provide dimensions of interactive learning, which serve to stimulate interest in Chinese Culture amongst our students. During Mother Tongue Fortnight, our students can also engage in library activities such as playing Chinese games and watching Chinese animation during recess. Students also take part in a series of class competitions such as Word-search from four-word Chinese idioms found on the school campus, story character drawing etc. The department also organized an online comic drawing lesson for the students.&nbsp; Students will learn how to draw Comics for different festivals such as Mid-Autumn Festival. They will then create a story using the comic’s character.&nbsp; It is an engaging session for the students as they have fun learning the skills and Chinese culture at the same time. All these activities cater to the learning of our students and create vibrancy for the learning of the Chinese Language.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:45%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chi4.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:45%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chi5.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:45%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chi6.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:45%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chi7.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:45%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chi8.jpg"></div><p><strong><u>D.&nbsp;Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme</u></strong><br>The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) (“文化随意门”计划) is an initiative led by The Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) since 2009. It enhances students' interest in the Chinese language and culture by giving them opportunities to experience Chinese cultural performances at public performing arts venues. We selected a similar theme from the show in the textbook to connect textbook learning with their daily life.</p><p><strong><u>E. Oral Enrichment Programme for Primary 6 Students</u></strong><br>This programme is designed specially to help selected Primary 6 students improve their Oracy skills. A group of parent volunteers is trained to conduct oral practice for selected students.</p><p><strong><u>F. Language &amp; Cultural Immersion to China</u></strong><br>Selected P5 students get to visit schools in China. The aim of this programme is to expose our students to the life and culture of their Chinese counterparts. We will visit our partner school - Qiao Yi Experimental Primary School in Wu Xi. Our students will make new friends and use the Chinese Language to communicate with the students from China. We will also visit various places of interest in Wuxi, Suzhou and Shanghai for an enriching learning experience.&nbsp; Some examples of a place of interest are Mudu Ancient Town where the students have hands-on experience in writing Chinese Calligraphy. The Three Kingdom City visit enables students to learn rich Chinese culture not only from books but also from a themed site. We will also visit museums in Suzhou and Shanghai to learn how technology played a part in the world.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:42%;margin-left:55px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chi9.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:42%;margin-right:55px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/chi10.jpg"></div><p><br></p><p><strong><u>G. Conversational Malay Programme</u></strong><br>In line with the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) efforts to nurture language proficiency amongst all students, ACS (Junior) is pleased to offer the Conversational Malay Programme (Beginner Module) for our students in Primary 3 who do not study the Malay Language. This enrichment programme aimed at equipping students with the basic linguistics skills, vocabulary and knowledge of the Malay Language, so that they would be able to interact better with their Malay friends and, in so doing, appreciate and understand each other’s culture.</p><p><strong><u>H. Hinch Programme</u></strong><br>The Hinch Programme aims to enthuse students and develop in them an abiding interest in the Chinese language through reading, reading comprehension and creative writing. We provide additional learning support to students through this after-school programme.</p><p><strong><u>I. E-Zhishi Online Learning Platform</u></strong><br>All students taking Chinese language have an E-zhishi Online Learning Account. This online resource allows students to learn and revise textbook contents at their own pace. The website also provides Oral practice materials, practice questions and e-books. The graded e-books have rich illustrations, audio support, and pinyin to meet students’ individual learning needs. There is a short quiz to evaluate understanding after reading each story. Teachers also make use of this online resource in class. Knight Badge is given to students to encourage the use of this learning platform.</p>
