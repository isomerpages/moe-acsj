Programmes
==============

<b><u>A. Chinese Reading Programme</b></u><br>
**1) Morning Chinese Book Reading Programme**<br>
Every Thursday and Friday morning from 7.20 am to 7.30 am, students will be reading Chinese storybooks.  This will help them to cultivate the habit of reading and appreciation of the Chinese Language.

**2) Book Review Programme**<br>
Students will participate in the Book Review Programme by completing book review activities to earn Knight Badge for their class. Some examples of these activities are making bookmarks, designing book covers, drawing favorite story characters and character mask design.

**3) Interactive Session with the Writer**<br>
Students have opportunities to interact with famous local Chinese story writers for an engaging storytelling session. They can benefit from enjoying interesting local stories and learning Chinese cultures through the Q&A sessions with the author.

<b><u>B. Mother Tongue Fortnight**</b></u><br>
Every year, the Chinese Language Department organizes the Mother Tongue Fortnight, which aims at promoting the learning of Chinese by engaging students in fun activities. Over two weeks, there will be a series of activities such as Drama House performances, Storytelling for lower Primary students, library activities, book fairs and reading activities conducted in class. Chinese Drama and Story-Telling provide dimensions of interactive learning, which serve to stimulate interest in Chinese Culture amongst our students. During Mother Tongue Fortnight, our students can also engage in library activities such as playing Chinese games and watching Chinese animation during recess. Students also take part in a series of class competitions such as Word-search from four-word Chinese idioms found on the school campus, story character drawing etc. The department also organized an online comic drawing lesson for the students.  Students will learn how to draw Comics for different festivals such as Mid-Autumn Festival. They will then create a story using the comic’s character.  It is an engaging session for the students as they have fun learning the skills and Chinese culture at the same time. All these activities cater to the learning of our students and create vibrancy for the learning of the Chinese Language.

<b><u>**D. Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme**</b></u><br>
The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) (“文化随意门”计划) is an initiative led by The Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) since 2009. It enhances students' interest in the Chinese language and culture by giving them opportunities to experience Chinese cultural performances at public performing arts venues. We selected a similar theme from the show in the textbook to connect textbook learning with their daily life.

<b><u>E. Oral Enrichment Programme for Primary 2 to Primary 6</b></u><br>
This programme is designed specially to help selected Primary 2 to Primary 6 students improve their Oracy skills. A group of parent volunteers is trained to conduct oral practice for selected students.

<b><u>F. Language & Cultural Immersion to China</b></u><br>
Selected P5 students get to visit schools in China. The aim of this programme is to expose our students to the life and culture of their Chinese counterparts. We will visit our partner school - Qiao Yi Experimental Primary School in Wu Xi. Our students will make new friends and use the Chinese Language to communicate with the students from China. We will also visit various places of interest in Wuxi, Suzhou and Shanghai for an enriching learning experience.  Some examples of a place of interest are Mudu Ancient Town where the students have hands-on experience in writing Chinese Calligraphy. The Three Kingdom City visit enables students to learn rich Chinese culture not only from books but also from a themed site. We will also visit museums in Suzhou and Shanghai to learn how technology played a part in the world.
