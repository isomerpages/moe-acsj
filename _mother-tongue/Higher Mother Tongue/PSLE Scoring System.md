PSLE Scoring System
=======================

<b><u>Higher Mother Tongue Language ( HMT) under the new PSLE Scoring System</u></b><br>
<b><u><i>(with effect from 2020 Primary 5 cohort)</i></u></b><br>

<u>HMT Examination Format:</u><br>
Paper 1 : Composition (40%)<br>
Paper 2 : Cloze Passages and Written Comprehension (60%)<br>
Total: 100%

<u>HMT Lessons (Hinch lessons):</u><br>
Thursday from 2pm to 3pm


<b><u>Use of HMT for Admission to SAP School</u></b><br>
*   When applying to SAP schools, HMT students will continue to receive an&nbsp;advantage.
*   Although HMT results do not count towards the PSLE Score, if students&nbsp;with the same PSLE Score are applying for limited places in the same&nbsp;SAP school, those with better HMT grades will be allocated a place ahead&nbsp;of other students. This applies before the tie-breakers for Secondary 1&nbsp;posting.
*   Let’s look at an example. There are 6 students competing for the last 2&nbsp;places in a SAP school. They have been arranged in descending order of&nbsp;posting priority. The student who has a PSLE Score of 7 will gain&nbsp;admission to the SAP school. Then, out of the students with a PSLE Score&nbsp;of 8, the student with a distinction for HCL (Higher Chinese) will be&nbsp;admitted into the SAP school next, ahead of the other students who also&nbsp;scored 8 but had weaker or no HCL score. The advantage that HCL&nbsp;students will obtain under the new system is similar to that under the&nbsp;current system.

*   SAP schools are Anglican High, Catholic High, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’,&nbsp;Chung Cheng High (Main), Dunman High, Maris Stella High, Nanyang&nbsp;Girls’ High, River Valley High and The Chinese High and Nan Chiau High
*   ACS (I) is not a SAP school.

<b><u>Eligibility for Higher Mother Tongue Language in Secondary School</u></b><br>
*   Under the new PSLE scoring system, students will be eligible to take&nbsp;Higher Mother Tongue Language in secondary school if they receive:<br>
a. An overall PSLE Score of 8 or better; or<br>
b. An overall PSLE Score of 9 to 14 (inclusive); and attain AL 1 / AL 2 in MTL&nbsp;or distinction/merit in HMT.
*   The eligibility criteria for secondary school HMT is intended to ensure that&nbsp;students can cope with the higher academic load, and takes reference&nbsp;from existing criteria. For students who do not meet the above criteria,&nbsp;secondary schools will continue to have the flexibility to offer HMT to&nbsp;students if they are assessed to have high ability and interest in MT, and&nbsp;are able to take HMT without affecting their performance in other subjects.&nbsp;This is similar to the existing practice.
