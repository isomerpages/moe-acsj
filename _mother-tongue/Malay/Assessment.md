facets of a child from various sources, with the aim of providing qualitative
and quantitative feedback to support and guide the child's development.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>
<br>1. Any pupil who is absent for a weighted assessment needs to produce
a Medical Certificate to cover him for that day. Marks will be pro-rated
accordingly.
<br>2. For&nbsp;Semestral Assessment, there is no make-up for Listening Comprehension
and main written papers. Pupils will not be eligible for academic awards
if they are absent for Semestral Assessment main papers.</p>
