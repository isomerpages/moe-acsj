Parents involvement are greatly encouraged during the conduct of the Mother Tongue Fortnight.

**Hinch Programme**<br>
The Hinch Programme aims to enthuse students and develop in them an abiding interest in Malay language and culture through reading, reading comprehension and creative writing. Additional learning support is also provided to students through this after school programme.

**Extensive Reading Programme**<br>
In 2020, the Malay language unit started its Extensive Reading Programme (ERP) for all levels. In this programme, students are introduced to various genres of Malay language books so as to encourage them to read for enjoyment and to develop general reading skills. From this programme, students will be able to increase their reading and writing competencies, improve their oral and aural skills, grow their vocabulary and increase their motivation, self-esteem and empathy. Students who read extensively also become more autonomous learners. At the end of Term 1, there will be a showcase of the Extensive Reading Programme and parents are invited to watch their children perform skits based on the books they have explored and enjoyed.

To further encourage children to read Mother Tongue language books, students are encouraged to read a Malay language storybook every Thursday and Friday morning from 7.20 am to 7.30 am. This will help to cultivate good reading habits and create a deeper appreciation of the Malay language.

**South Zone S5 Cluster Malay Storytelling Competition 'Bacalah Adikku'**<br>
'Bacalah Adikku' is an annual Malay storytelling competition organised by the Malay language unit of ACS(J). Students from all of the S5 Cluster schools take part in this competition virtually and prizes are awarded to top winners of each category. All Primary 1 to 3 students from ACS(J) are encouraged to take part in this competition. Through this competition, students will get the opportunity to use the language in an authentic learning experience and further instill their love for the language. 

**Hari Raya Celebrations**<br>
Every year, during this festive period, our students will put up a short assembly programme for the school to share about Hari Raya Aidilfitri. Students will be given the opportunity to become emcees and also to put up a short performance related to Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
