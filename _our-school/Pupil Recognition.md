**Edusave Merit Bursaries**

**P1 and P2**

In line with moderating the over-emphasis on academic results, MOE has removed all weighted assessments for Primary 1 (P1) and Primary 2 (P2) students from 2019. These adjustments aim to free up more time for teachers to engage students in learning. Without having to worry about examinations and grades, young students will have a more positive start to their education, focusing on discovery, the joy of learning and holistic development. In tandem with this removal, MOE has revised the academic criteria for Edusave Merit Bursary (EMB) and Edusave Good Progress Award (GPA) at the lower primary levels. Instead of selecting students based on academic results, form teachers, in consultation with class subject teachers, will nominate students based on **key learning dispositions** that they observe. 

  

From 2019, all P1 and P2 Singaporean students in Government and Government-aided schools can be nominated for the Edusave Merit Bursary, if they have consistently demonstrated positive learning dispositions in the course of the year and have demonstrated good conduct. In ACS (J), we observe our students for their demonstration of positive learning dispositions in the areas of Collaboration, Curiosity and Excellence. 

  

All P1, P2 EMB nominees will receive the EMB if they satisfy the household income criterion, i.e. gross monthly household income does not exceed $6,900 (or per capita income does not exceed $1,725). The value of the bursary is $200 for Primary 1 to 2 students. P1, P2 EMB nominees who do not meet the household income criterion and have not received other Edusave Awards, including the Edusave Character Award (ECHA), will continue to qualify for the Education Merit Award (EMA) administered by People’s Association.

  

**P3 to P6**

All Singaporean P3 to P6 students in Government and Government-aided schools, junior colleges/centralised institute, independent schools or institutions, specialised schools or Institute of Technical Education who are not recipients of any Edusave Scholarship are eligible for the Edusave Merit Bursary if they are within the top 25% of each level and course in their schools, have demonstrated good conduct, and their monthly gross household income does not exceed $6,900. To benefit students from bigger households, they are also eligible if their per capita household income, i.e. gross household income divided by the number of household members does not exceed $1,725. The value of the bursary is $200 for Primary 3 students and $250 for Primary 4 to 6 students.  

**Edusave Good Progress Awards**  

**P2 and P3**

All P2 and P3 Singaporean students in Government and Government-aided schools who do not qualify for the Edusave Merit Bursary can be nominated for the Edusave Good Progress Award, if they have shown the greatest improvement in learning dispositions in the course of the year and demonstrated good conduct. The value of the award is $100 for Primary 2 to 3 students.  

  

**P4 to P6**

All Singaporean pupils from Primary 4 onwards in Government and Government-aided schools, junior colleges/centralised institute, independent schools or institutions, specialised schools or Institute of Technical Education who are not recipients of any Edusave Scholarship or Edusave Merit Bursary are eligible for the Edusave Good Progress Award if they are among the top 10% who have made significant improvement in their academic performance based on their overall examination results compared to the previous year. The value of the award is $150 for Primary 4 to 6 students.
