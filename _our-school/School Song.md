School Song
===========

In days of yore from western shores

Oldham dauntless hero came

and planted a beacon of Truth and Light

in this island of the Main.

Here may it stand from year to year

emblem of grand endeavour

The regions round echo the sound

of A.C.S. forever.

(Chorus)

Sing A.C.S. forever more,

our A.C.S. forever.

God save our land and heaven bless

our A.C.S. forever.

  

Our students hail from China's plains

and the Land of Rising Sun.

We have many sons from India's Strand

and the Islands of the Main.

Our hearts our hopes our aims are one.

No discord e'er will sever.

We'll stand together for the cause

of A.C.S. forever.

  

(Chorus)

Sing A.C.S. forever more,

our A.C.S. forever.

God save our land and heaven bless

our A.C.S. forever.
