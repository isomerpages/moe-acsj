School Song
===========

**requires school to upload audio to youtube**

In days of yore from western shores<br>
Oldham dauntless hero came<br>
and planted a beacon of Truth and Light<br>
in this island of the Main.<br>
Here may it stand from year to year<br>
emblem of grand endeavour<br>
The regions round echo the sound<br>
of A.C.S. forever.

(Chorus)<br>
Sing A.C.S. forever more,<br>
our A.C.S. forever.<br>
God save our land and heaven bless<br>
our A.C.S. forever.

Our students hail from China's plains<br>
and the Land of Rising Sun.<br>
We have many sons from India's Strand<br>
and the Islands of the Main.<br>
Our hearts our hopes our aims are one.<br>
No discord e'er will sever.<br>
We'll stand together for the cause<br>
of A.C.S. forever.

(Chorus)<br>
Sing A.C.S. forever more,<br>
our A.C.S. forever.<br>
God save our land and heaven bless<br>
our A.C.S. forever.
