Road Safety of Students
=======================

  
We would like to seek your cooperation to work with the school in ensuring the safety of students coming to and leaving school. This is especially important as young children may not have the skills required to use roads properly. Their small physique also makes them less visible to motorists.

The road safety policies of the school is as follows:

a.    Reduce vehicle speed and stay alert for pedestrians in the school zone.

b.    Cooperate with traffic marshals to ensure overall safety and smooth traffic flow.

c.     Let your child alight only at the designated drop-off point.

d.    Be advised not to violate traffic rules by driving recklessly or making illegal maneuvers such as turning into the school from the outer lane(s) of the road.

e.    Do not sound the horn indiscriminately.

f.      Help your child alight from the car on the side nearest to the kerb as quickly as possible.

g.    Reinforce correct road safety behaviour such as using pedestrian crossings and avoiding jaywalking or using the mobile phone while crossing. 

h.    Remind your children to practise the kerb drill before crossing – “look right, look left, look right again, ensure all vehicles have stopped, raise your hand high up and cross the road briskly”.

i.      If your child must cycle to school, ensure that he knows safe cycling rules and is a competent cyclist.  
  

**For the safety of everyone, enforcement action will be taken against motorists who violate traffic rules.**
