<h1>School Rules</h1>
<p><strong>ANGLO-CHINESE SCHOOL (JUNIOR)</strong>
</p>
<p>ACS(J) is committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment
for all. The goal of school discipline is to help students develop self-discipline,
through making good choices that will enable them to experience success
in life. Through a positive learning environment based on school and good
moral values, positive character traits are learned and practised. Everyone
is responsible for their actions and the consequences of their actions.
Parents, students, and school staff work together to give essential support
to the learning process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our aim is to develop young gentlemen of character who will make
good choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our core beliefs for discipline are as follows:
<br>&nbsp;1.&nbsp; All students are capable of behaving appropriately.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Misbehaviour is a matter of choice.
<br>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; A student will accept responsibility&nbsp;for his&nbsp;actions.
<br>&nbsp;4.&nbsp; Teachers have a right to teach without disruption.
<br>&nbsp;5.&nbsp; Students have a right and responsibility to learn and feel
safe at school.
<br>&nbsp;6.&nbsp; Respect must be shown to everyone at all times.</p>
<p><strong>CODE OF CONDUCT AND SCHOOL RULES</strong>
<br><strong>PERSONAL CONDUCT</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Attendance</em></strong>
<br>It is compulsory for every student to attend school. Students must not
leave the school during curriculum hours, including supplementary and remedial
classes, without authorisation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Absence From School</em></strong>
<br>A student who is absent from School is required to submit a Medical Certificate
(MC) or a letter of excuse from parents/guardians.</p>
<p><strong><em>Late-coming</em></strong>&nbsp;
<br>Students should be punctual for all school activities. Students who reach
school after 7.30am are considered late. Their parents will be informed
after three incidents of late-coming. From the fourth incidence of late-coming
onwards, their names will be recorded in the school system, which will
be reflected in the student's report book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Leaving School During Curriculum Hours</em></strong>
<br>School hours are from 7.30am to 1.30pm. A student who leaves the school
during curriculum hours must first obtain a permission slip duly signed
by the subject teacher at that point of time. The permission slip will
then be signed by the parent/guardian who is picking the student up and
handed in to the receptionist before the student is allowed to leave the
school. No student is allowed to leave the school during curriculum hours
without being accompanied by a parent/guardian.</p>
<p><strong>ATTIRE &amp; GROOMING</strong>
<br>Proper attire and grooming have a positive impact on the image of the
school and the students. Every student must project an appropriate and
well-groomed appearance and wear his school uniform with pride and propriety.</p>
<p><strong>Pupils are to wear the prescribed school uniform.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Modification to the uniform is not allowed.</strong>

the pocket tucked into the navy-blue shorts with the ACS label sewn at
the back. The name tag of the student should be above the pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The uniform is to be worn with white shoes and socks. If track shoes are
worn, they should be predominately white (including white shoelaces). Only
plain white socks or socks with the ACS(J) label are to be worn. Socks
worn must not be below the ankle. Only Primary 1 and 2 students are allowed
to wear shoes with Velcro straps.</p>
</li>

<p><strong><u>Use of smartphones and/or smartwatches</u></strong>
</p>
<p>While we discourage students from bringing smartphones/smartwatches, we
understand that some parents prefer to have their children carry these
devices for the convenience of communication and safety, especially children
who are travelling alone on public transport or commuting long distances
to school. Kindly refer to the points below which are designed to provide
students and parents with guidelines and instructions for the appropriate
use of these devices during school hours.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
