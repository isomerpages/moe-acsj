School Rules
============

**ANGLO-CHINESE SCHOOL (JUNIOR)**

  

ACS(J) is committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all. The goal of school discipline is to help pupils develop self-discipline, through making good choices that will enable them to experience success in life. Through a positive learning environment based on school and good moral values, positive character traits are learned and practised. Everyone is responsible for their actions and the consequences of their actions. Parents, pupils, and school staff work together to give essential support to the learning process.

Our aim is to develop young gentlemen of character who will make good choices.

Our core beliefs for discipline are as follows:

 1.  All pupils are capable of behaving appropriately. 

 2.  Misbehaviour is a matter of choice.

 3.  A pupil will accept responsibility for his actions.

 4.  Teachers have a right to teach without disruption.

 5.  Pupils have a right and responsibility to learn and feel safe at school.

 6.  Respect must be shown to everyone at all times.

  



**CODE OF CONDUCT AND SCHOOL RULES**



**PERSONAL CONDUCT**

**_Attendance_**

It is compulsory for every pupil to attend school. Pupils must not leave the school during curriculum hours, including supplementary and remedial classes, without authorisation.

_**Absence From School**_

A pupil who is absent from School is required to submit a Medical Certificate (MC) or a letter of excuse from parents/guardians. 

**_Late-coming_** 

Pupils will be punctual for all school activities. Pupils who reach school after 7.30am are considered late. Their parents will be informed after three incidents of late-coming. From the fourth incidence of late-coming onwards, their names will be recorded in the school system, which will be reflected in the pupil's report book. 

  

**_Leaving School During Curriculum Hours_**

School hours are from 7.30 am to 1.30 pm. A pupil who leaves the school during curriculum hours must first obtain a permission slip duly signed by the subject teacher at that point of time. The permission slip will then be signed by the parent/guardian who is picking the pupil up and handed in to the receptionist before the pupil is allowed to leave the school. No pupil is allowed to leave the school during curriculum hours without being accompanied by a parent/guardian. 

**ATTIRE & GROOMING**

Proper attire and grooming have a positive impact on the image of the school and the pupils. Every pupil must project an appropriate and well-groomed appearance, and wear his school uniform with pride and propriety.

**Pupils are to wear the prescribed school uniform. Modification to the uniform is not allowed.**

**Formal uniform consists of:**

Use of Mobile Phones

*   While we discourage pupils from bringing mobile phones, we understand that some parents prefer to have their children carry mobile phones for the convenience of communication and safety, especially children travelling alone on public transport or commuting long distances to school. Kindly refer to the points below which are designed to provide pupils and parents with guidelines and instructions for the appropriate use of mobile phones during school hours.
    
      
    
*   **The mobile phone must be labelled with pupil’s name and class.** 
*   The mobile phone must be switched off and kept out of sight during all school activities (ie. lessons, chapel, assembly, recess, CCAs, excursions).
*   Pupils will use the mobile phones solely for communication and not for playing games, taking still or moving images, or surfing the internet.
*   The use of the mobile phone is restricted to before and after school at the foyer only and/or when permission is granted by a teacher. Restriction on use of mobile phone applies to pupils during excursions, camps and co-curriculum activities.
*   **The school will not be responsible for the loss or damage of the mobile phone.** 
*   No mobile phones will be allowed in examination rooms. Pupils are to surrender their mobile phones (in the event they bring it to school on any examination day) to the teacher in the classroom. The mobile phones will be returned to the pupils after all the examinations for that day.
*   **Pupils who fail to abide by the rules will have their mobile phones (including SIM card) confiscated. Confiscated mobile phones can only be collected by pupil’s parents.**
*   Repeat offenders will be barred from bringing any mobile phone to school.
