School Rules
============

**ANGLO-CHINESE SCHOOL (JUNIOR)**

ACS(J) is committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all. The goal of school discipline is to help pupils develop self-discipline, through making good choices that will enable them to experience success in life. Through a positive learning environment based on school and good moral values, positive character traits are learned and practised. Everyone is responsible for their actions and the consequences of their actions. Parents, pupils, and school staff work together to give essential support to the learning process.

Our aim is to develop young gentlemen of character who will make good choices.

Our core beliefs for discipline are as follows:<br>
1\.  All pupils are capable of behaving appropriately. <br>
2\.  Misbehaviour is a matter of choice.<br>
3\.  A pupil will accept responsibility for his actions.<br>
4\.  Teachers have a right to teach without disruption.<br>
5\.  Pupils have a right and responsibility to learn and feel safe at school.<br>
6\.  Respect must be shown to everyone at all times.

**CODE OF CONDUCT AND SCHOOL RULES**<br>
**PERSONAL CONDUCT**

**_Attendance_**<br>
It is compulsory for every pupil to attend school. Pupils must not leave the school during curriculum hours, including supplementary and remedial classes, without authorisation.

_**Absence From School**_<br>
A pupil who is absent from School is required to submit a Medical Certificate (MC) or a letter of excuse from parents/guardians. 

**_Late-coming_** <br>
Pupils will be punctual for all school activities. Pupils who reach school after 7.30am are considered late. Their parents will be informed after three incidents of late-coming. From the fourth incidence of late-coming onwards, their names will be recorded in the school system, which will be reflected in the pupil's report book. 

**_Leaving School During Curriculum Hours_**<br>
School hours are from 7.30 am to 1.30 pm. A pupil who leaves the school during curriculum hours must first obtain a permission slip duly signed by the subject teacher at that point of time. The permission slip will then be signed by the parent/guardian who is picking the pupil up and handed in to the receptionist before the pupil is allowed to leave the school. No pupil is allowed to leave the school during curriculum hours without being accompanied by a parent/guardian. 

**ATTIRE & GROOMING**<br>
Proper attire and grooming have a positive impact on the image of the school and the pupils. Every pupil must project an appropriate and well-groomed appearance, and wear his school uniform with pride and propriety.

**Pupils are to wear the prescribed school uniform. Modification to the uniform is not allowed.**

**Formal uniform consists of:**<br>
