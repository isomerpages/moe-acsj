Supporting Singaporean Students
===============================

Dear Parents/Guardian

MOE has prepared a brochure on the various schemes that have been put in place to support our Singaporean students. The brochure also highlights the enhancements and new initiatives that were announced at the MOE Committee of Supply last month.

We hope to provide readers with a broad overview of the many schemes that we currently have in place and they can approach the school or MOE if they would like to find out more about specific schemes.

More about MOE’s Committee of Supply announcements can be found in this [link](http://www.moe.gov.sg/committee-of-supply-debate/)

A copy of the [e-brochure](http://acsj.moe.edu.sg/docs/internal_pages/our_school/supporting_singaporean_students/English%20Brochure%202012%20%28L%29.pdf) is available. We hope you find this useful for the purpose of engaging parents and the wider community.

With Regards,

Administration Office
